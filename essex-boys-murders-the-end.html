His findings help form a new three-part series on Sky Documentaries</p><p>Former gangland figure <a href=#>Dave Courtney,</a> who contributes to the documentary, has said that the case marked a watershed in London crime.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>Mr Courtney said to The Sun: "The world of the Essex Boys still exists but it has changed.</p><p>"There was a time when London crime was dominated by Londoners. But that is no longer the case."</p><p>Mr Courtney now said that the hierarchy of crime in London was dominated by individuals from Eastern Europe.</p><p>Mr Courtney, who claims to have spent time in Belmarsh prison when he was a young man, said that notorious crimes such as the Brinks Matt robbery belonged to an era that is now gone forever.</p><p>Mr Courtney, from south London, said that the so called Essex Boy murders had changed the way in which crime groups operated in London.</p><p>He said: "That incident brought too much heat on certain people.</p><p>"Things like that tend to be avoided now.</p><p>"People tend to just go missing now."</p><p>Mr Courtney explained that when people went missing it led to much less interest from the media.</p><p>He said that he remembered the incident well, but was not shocked when it happened.</p><p>Mr Courtney explained that the three victims were involved in a certain lifestyle which brought with it huge risks.</p><p>He said: "It's part of that life. But when you are in that life you cannot worry or be fearful. "</p><p>Mr Courtney said that he believed that the convictions of Steele and Whomes may be "unsafe."</p><p>He added that he believed the three victims were murdered in relation to a fall-out in the drug business.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/one-unassuming-corner-south-east-771924495.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/9bb43169-ab32-49c3-baed-93198cb83438.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/essex-murders-documentary-anonymous-witness-808016168-1.jpg><p>The three victims had controlled the supply of ecstasy in the Basildon nightclub Raquels where tragic Leah Betts had taken the drug.</p><p>The teen was left in a coma after taking an ecstasy pill at her 18th birthday party and died 15 days later in hospital. Her death led to a national outcry about drugs in nightclubs.</p><p>Five months after the slaying ex-BT engineer Darren Nicholls was caught with a drug haul. Nicholls agreed to tell police about who was responsible for the Rettendon murders.</p><p>After Whomes and Steele were jailed for life Nicholls was given a new identity as a protected witness.</p><p>But now investigators probing the case on TV say Essex Police dismissed the taped evidence which tells a very different story.</p><p>The lead initially comes from a police informant known as 'Witness A' who claims he drove a hitman to the scene of the crime, as revealed by The Sun.</p><p>The tapes - heard for the first time in public - outline a sinister plot to take out violent cocaine addict Craig Rolfe, 26, his bodybuilder ‘enforcer’ Pat Tate, 36, and Tucker, a close pal of champion boxer Nigel Benn.</p><p>In a hotel room meeting, the anonymous figure said: “There was an armed robbery. The robbery is the key to it all really.</p><p>"It was a van full of cash, £495,000 got stolen.<br>“The whole thing was a balls up, if you like, because shortly after some of the robbers went splashing the money. It wasn’t long before everyone knew what happened.</p><p>“We got arrested and while we were in jail some of the money was given to Tony Tucker. It was given to him for safe-keeping.</p><p>“When we got out we asked for the money back but it wasn’t forthcoming and excuses were made, it’s tied up, this sort of thing, he couldn’t get it.</p><p>“By then he was drugged up, steroid upped, running around doing all sorts of business and in the end we knew it (the money) just wasn't coming back.</p><p>“He thought he was bigger than anyone. He thought there was nothing anyone could do. But he was wrong.<br>“A meeting was held and the problem solved.”</p><p>The fixer goes on to admit he paid the money to have them shot, adding: “I wasn’t bothered about the money, the money was irrelevant. It was the principal. Tucker was the target, the other two were collateral damage.”</p><p>Investigator and former Det Supt Dave McKelvey told The Sun: “I strongly believe there has been a miscarriage of justice.</p><p>“In the years that have passed, Whomes missed seeing his young children grow up while Steele is an old man who has become almost institutionalised.</p><p>“Times have moved on so much from when they were first jailed that when I mention social media to Steele he has no idea what I’m talking about.”</p><p>Essex Police stand by the convictions.</p><p>A spokesperson for the force said: “There has been an exhaustive police investigation into the murders of Pat Tate, Tony Tucker and Craig Rolfe in Rettendon on 6 December 1995, which resulted in the conviction of Michael Steele and Jack Whomes for their murder.</p><p>“Since those convictions this case has been back before the Court of appeal twice, in 1999 and 2006.</p><p>"These appeals have included focus upon the evidence of Witness A and the credibility of the key prosecution witness in the original<br>trial.</p><p>"Both appeals were rejected and in 2006 Lord Justice Kay commented that there was no “element of unsafety” relating to the original convictions of both defendants.</p><p>"This case has also been reviewed by the Criminal Cases<br>Review Commission who, as recently as January 2023, took the decision not to refer this case back to the Court of<br>Appeal.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"We welcome this decision as this case has been exhaustively examined over the last 27 years and there remains no fresh evidence identified which would call the original verdicts into question.”</p><p><strong>The Essex Murders starts at 9.25pm tonight on Sky Documentaries.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ39xgJhpaW9nlajApsSMm6ayq12iwrOwxKuqZqyYmnqmusNo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fessex-boys-murders-the-end.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fessex-boys-murders-the-end.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fessex-boys-murders-the-end.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fessex-boys-murders-the-end.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fessex-boys-murders-the-end.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fessex-boys-murders-the-end.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kai-lightner.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kai-lightner.html>Kai Lightner</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ben-lamb-poker-player.html>Fame | Ben Lamb (poker player) net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ben-lamb-poker-player.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
