They kinda need me. Thank you.”</p><p>Sara then rushed off the stage before the judges, all three visibly baffled, could respond.</p><p>Backstage, she said: “It went a lot better than I thought it would but I’m gonna head home to get back to my babies.”</p><p><a href=#>The judges</a>&nbsp;and producers were able to convince her to come back on stage, and Katy made an impassioned plea for her to stay.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>pop</a>&nbsp;singer said: “Sara Beth. I know life is scary. I also know that it’s easier to walk away than to be rejected.</p><p>"But then I also know that you lose out on your fullest potential and I know that you love your family for your kids."</p><p>She went on: "I know that as a mother but remember self-love is just as big as motherly love. Don’t leave the competition.”</p><p>After hearing her plea, Sara headed backstage again where she told a producer: “I feel like I’m not gonna win the show anyway so I might as well leave.”</p><p>Sara took the stage one more time, with Katy pleading: “Do not give up.”</p><p>Backstage, she revealed: “I still kinda want to go home. I’m sure that when I get home I’ll regret it. I’ll probably go, 'Damn, Sara. You should have done it.'”</p><p>Ultimately, she did leave the show.</p><h2>MEAN MOMMY</h2><p>Earlier this season, Katy took serious heat for&nbsp;<a href=#>how she treated Sara</a>.</p><p>Shortly after, Sara spoke out and accused the singer of&nbsp;<a href=#>"mom-shaming her,"</a>&nbsp;among other things.</p><p>During an early episode of American Idol, Sara was seen auditioning for the show.</p><p>Judges struggled to believe she was really 25 as&nbsp;<a href=#>Luke Bryan</a>&nbsp;told her: "You look 16."</p><p>Katy chimed in: "15."</p><p>Sara replied: "I have three kids, so that's like–."</p><p>At that moment, Katy jumped out of her seat and turned around, placing her hands on the table near Luke and fanning herself.</p><p>"Are you OK, Katy?" he asked.&nbsp;</p><p>"Nope," the 38-year-old shook her head before returning to her seat.</p><p>"If Katy lays on the table, I think I'm gonna pass out," Sara Beth chuckled.</p><p>"Three kids?"&nbsp;<a href=#>Lionel Richie</a>&nbsp;asked.&nbsp;</p><p>"Honey, you've been laying on the table too much," Katy snapped.&nbsp;</p><p>This comment from Katy offended Sara Beth.</p><p>Luke laughed and the contestant seemed OK with it at the time but later&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke up about it</a>&nbsp;on her&nbsp;<a href=#>Tiktok</a>&nbsp;page.</p><p>Sara Beth took a break from her usual cover song videos and videos with her kids to talk about how she felt about Katy's comments.</p><p>"At the start of my audition, before I sang, I mentioned that I had three children. That I was a young mom," she said.</p><p>"And Katy Perry 'made a joke,'" Sara Beth continued, putting the last three words in quotes, "that wasn't super kind."</p><p>"I don't really have too much to say on my feelings about it because I feel like it's probably pretty self-explanatory."</p><p>She continued: "I mean it was embarrassing to have that on TV and it was hurtful and you know, that's that.</p><p>"But, I did want to take this opportunity to just say that women supporting and uplifting other women is so cool and I think that mom-shaming is super lame."</p><p>"And I think that it's hard enough to be a mom and it's hard enough to be a woman," Sara Beth said.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The contestant ended: "I don't think there's really any more to it. If you love your babies and you're a good momma then that's all that really matters, and other comments just don't feel necessary."</p><p>Katy is mom to two-year-old&nbsp;<a href=#>Daisy Dove</a>&nbsp;with her partner,&nbsp;<a href=#>Orlando Bloom</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/katy-perry-stunned-singer-sara-807419782.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/katy-perry-stunned-singer-sara-807419647-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/katy-perry-stunned-singer-sara-807419781-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvZ22CcoGRaJimnaKesKK6jKKbqKSjYriiwNhmp56qoq56rrvCpKpmm5%2Bhtq950q2mrp%2BYqHqir8Kepa1n</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2famerican-idols-katy-perry-mocks-colin-stoughs-accent.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2famerican-idols-katy-perry-mocks-colin-stoughs-accent.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2famerican-idols-katy-perry-mocks-colin-stoughs-accent.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2famerican-idols-katy-perry-mocks-colin-stoughs-accent.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2famerican-idols-katy-perry-mocks-colin-stoughs-accent.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2famerican-idols-katy-perry-mocks-colin-stoughs-accent.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./mos-def-arrested-in-south-africa-for-using-a-world-passport.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./mos-def-arrested-in-south-africa-for-using-a-world-passport.html>ARRESTED in South Africa for Using a &amp;quot;World Passport&amp;quot;</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-kelly-reilly-dating.html>Who is Kelly Reilly Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-kelly-reilly-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
