<time>09 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>The injury incident from his last game has left fans horrified. Some have even speculated that the injury has led to Treylon Burks death.</strong></p><p>However, the news of Burk’s death is uncalled for, and he is making a speedy recovery in the hospital.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Treylon-Burks-Executing-A-Play-From-The-Teams-Playbook.jpg><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Treylon Burks</a> is a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL) for the Tennessee Titans.</p><p>Burks was born in Flint, Michigan, on March 23, 2000, and grew up in Warren, Arkansas. He went to Warren High School and played wide receiver for the football team.</p><p>On top of being a football player, he also loved playing basketball and baseball during high school.</p><p>On July 30, 2018, he committed to play college football at the University of Arkansas.</p><p>He earned a four-star recruit status, ranking 103rd in the US and holding the top prospect position in Arkansas. The Titans selected Burks 18th overall in the 2022 draft.</p><p>Tennessee gave up receiver A. J. Brown in exchange for the draft pick from the Philadelphia Eagles, as well as a third-round pick in 2023.</p><p>Furthermore, Burks is an adrenaline junkie, and hog hunting is one of his favorite hobbies.&nbsp;</p><h2>Here’s What You Need To Know About Treylon Burks Death Rumors</h2><p>Firstly, the news of the death of Treylon Burks is a massive hoax spread by agencies hungry for clout.&nbsp;He is very alive but not so well as he is undergoing treatment at the moment.</p><p>In a recent game against Pittsburgh, Titans wide receiver <a href=# rel=noopener>Burks suffered a brief loss of consciousness</a> and is now in concussion protocol.</p><p>Burks was in the air leaping for a pass on fourth down along the left sideline. He landed hard out of bounds with his head bouncing off the turf.</p><p>The medical staff immediately rushed in to help Burks as he lost consciousness. They secured Burks to a backboard and removed his face mask after the incident.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Treylon-Burks-Being-Carted-Away-After-His-Injury.jpeg><p>The receiver stayed down for a few minutes, and they put him on a stretcher as a precaution against a possible spinal injury.</p><p>He wiggled his toes and gave a thumbs-up as they loaded him onto the cart, and then he departed the field.</p><p>Players from both teams watched nearby. This was why many fans started to worry that he was dead.</p><p>His coach, Mike Vrabel, mentioned that he had exchanged texts with Burks confirming that he was alive.</p><p>Additionally, he also expressed hope for his speedy recovery and commended everyone for following protocol to ensure Burks’ well-being.</p><h2>When It comes to Injuries, Burks Is No Stranger</h2><p>Burks has been injured so many times that it is a surprise that he made it this far into his career.&nbsp;</p><p>His previous concussion occurred on December 4, 2022, during his only touchdown reception in a game against the Eagles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Treylon-Burks-Taking-Rest-After-His-Trainig.jpg><p>In this season, while participating in a joint practice with the Vikings, Burks hauled in a deep pass and suffered an LCL sprain upon landing on his knee.</p><p>In Week 4 of 2022, Burks experienced turf toe, and the team put him on injured reserve on October 8. They subsequently activated him from injured reserve on November 12, 2022.</p><p>In his high school career, he missed most of his senior season in 2018 after tearing his ACL. However, injuries are all part of the game, and we wish him a speedy recovery.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunDA0Z6wpaeeYq%2B2vsqsZJ2dkam1brTOmq9mr6JitrR5wKWgr51dl8K1ecinZJynnpjCtL%2FIqKVmqKKkwbCvzqVm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftreylon-burks-death-hoax-wr-is-alive-but-in-concussion-protocol.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftreylon-burks-death-hoax-wr-is-alive-but-in-concussion-protocol.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftreylon-burks-death-hoax-wr-is-alive-but-in-concussion-protocol.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftreylon-burks-death-hoax-wr-is-alive-but-in-concussion-protocol.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftreylon-burks-death-hoax-wr-is-alive-but-in-concussion-protocol.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftreylon-burks-death-hoax-wr-is-alive-but-in-concussion-protocol.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./walmart-cult-classic-black-friday-bargains.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./walmart-cult-classic-black-friday-bargains.html>Walmart brings back a cult classic in major change to shake-up Black Friday &amp;amp; how people shop &amp;amp; get</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ron-hart.html>Ron Hart</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ron-hart.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
