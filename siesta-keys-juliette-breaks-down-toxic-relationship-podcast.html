<time>18 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Focusing on herself! <strong>Juliette Porter</strong> has washed her hands clean from <strong>Alex Kompos</strong> following what she refers to as a “toxic” romance. During the Tuesday, February 26, episode of <a href=#>Siesta Key</a>, the 21-year-old confronted her longtime boyfriend after finding two girls in his bed. While they got back together by the end of the show, things went a bit differently than shown on TV.</p><p>Juliette joined <a href=#>this week’s “Watch With Us” podcast</a> to share all the details and give Us an update on their relationship today. Listen to the full <a href=#>episode</a> above – plus, get some important tidbits below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Siesta-Keys-Juliette-Porter.jpg><p><strong>On what happened in Alex’s room:</strong><br>“I showed up to his house early and all the doors were locked. I found one door that he actually uses as a window that has blinds in front of it. I think he forgot that it’s a door and that’s the only one that was open. I knew in the back of my mind, like, he knew I was there. He must have looked outside the window, saw my car and quickly locked the doors and forgot one. … I climbed over the couch and I saw him standing in front of his bedroom. I saw a girl sleeping.”</p><p><strong>On the timeline – from finding the girls to breaking up with Alex to getting back together:</strong><br>“I think that was maybe three weeks? It was really tough, everything was happening so fast. I didn’t even have time to think about what was going on, especially with everyone in my ear. I just wanted things to go back to normal, but in the back of my mind, I was thinking, ‘This is gonna change everything.’”</p><p><strong>On off-camera conversations with Alex:</strong><br>“Those are the ones that area kinda difficult for me; if it’s just him and I, he’s kind of saying, ‘It didn’t happen, I would never do that.’ I want to trust him, so those were almost worse for me. On camera, I try to use my head a little more. When there’s a camera watching me, I’m like, ‘Wait, what are other people going to think about this? What’s the best way to do this?’”</p><p><strong>On taking Alex back:</strong><br>“It’s hard because I trusted him at the time; he was my best friend. You never really know what other people are gonna pull. … I wanted to feel safe. In the long run that didn’t really end up working out.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Juliette-Porter.jpg><p><strong>On Cara and Alex:</strong><br>“As much as we want to pretend that the cameras aren’t around, I really assumed that Alex wouldn’t do something with her, even if he wanted to because there were cameras watching him all the time. I never thought they were actually going to hook up, I just thought it was rude that she was coming around and the things she said about me and my boyfriend at the time were terrible. I never thought he would do something like that, but I guess I was wrong.”</p><p><strong>On the last breakup:</strong><br>“We’ve been on and off for a long time. … We went back and forth a lot; I broke up with him in October for about a month; it was a toxic relationship. We tried again until about a month ago. After that, I was like, ‘We just have to rip the band-aid off.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>On not watching anymore back:</strong><br>“After this week, I can’t go back and watch that. In the moment, I understood how I was feeling, how heartbroken I was and this was a really big deal. I don’t want to act the way I was acting, but I would have handled things a lot better if I were able to just leave, and I wasn’t able to leave. … I begged the producers to let me, like, have a week off. They were, like, ‘We can’t, we have a deadline.’ And I understand that but I think in the situation I was in, I was just so emotional. I don’t want to watch it anymore, I don’t want to see myself in that state.”</p><p>Siesta Key&nbsp;airs on MTV Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqinaOprm63xLKqZqKlobamwNOeZJuqlZa4tHnDqK6nZaSkxaqvjKucpZmknryvv8eip2aon5mwor%2FTaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsiesta-keys-juliette-breaks-down-toxic-relationship-podcast.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsiesta-keys-juliette-breaks-down-toxic-relationship-podcast.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsiesta-keys-juliette-breaks-down-toxic-relationship-podcast.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsiesta-keys-juliette-breaks-down-toxic-relationship-podcast.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsiesta-keys-juliette-breaks-down-toxic-relationship-podcast.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsiesta-keys-juliette-breaks-down-toxic-relationship-podcast.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./xqxxkt-ual82cyrgq12k8vwsrqorspac.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./xqxxkt-ual82cyrgq12k8vwsrqorspac.html>Watch RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars Season 4 Episode 8: RuPaul's Best Judy's Race</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./selena-gomez-to-headline-dallas-cowboys-thanksgiving-halftime-sh.html>Selena Gomez to Headline Dallas Cowboys' Halftime Show on Thanksgiving</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./selena-gomez-to-headline-dallas-cowboys-thanksgiving-halftime-sh.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
