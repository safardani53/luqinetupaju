<time>20 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>HE may have won the Wimbledon’s men’s title for a fifth time this year, but fans are fearing that tennis legend Novak Djokovic may have lost the support of his biggest champion - his wife.</p><p>Beautiful&nbsp;<a href=#>Jelena, 33, failed to attend any of his matches</a> during the tournament, which has led to <a href=#>intense speculation that all is not well in their marriage</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000507895511.jpg><p>Their fifth wedding anniversary on July 10 also went unmarked in public - a stark contrast to last year, when Jelena posted a doting anniversary message: “Love loving you my love.”</p><p>The previous year Novak publicly praised his wife, calling her his "soulmate" and saying she'd taught him why love is so important.</p><p>Novak put Jelena's Wimbledon no-show down to their daughter, Tara, one, being too young to attend – their four-year-old son Stefan was with his parents in the players’ box for the final.</p><p>And <a href=#>his wife was quick to congratulate him on social media after his epic victory over Roger Federer</a>, writing him a gushing post full of hearts and kisses.</p><p>But this isn't the first time the 32 year-old tennis star’s marriage has come under scrutiny.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000507902211.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Novak Djokovic addresses his family during his Wimbledon 2019 winner’s speech</span><h2><strong>Tiger comparisons</strong></h2><p>Rumours reached fever pitch in July 2017 when tennis commentator John McEnroe blamed Novak's poor form on his "off-court issues with the family" - and even likened his downward slide to that of golfer Tiger Woods, <a href=#>who split from his wife Elin Nordegren</a> when it was revealed he'd cheated on her with 120 women.</p><p>"Woods had the issues with his wife and then he seemed to go completely off the rails and has never been even close to being the same player," John said.</p><p>"So we're starting to say: 'Wait a minute, is this possible with him, Djokovic?'"</p><p>Novak was surprised by the comments, but issued a gentlemanly response: "He has his right to say the things he wants to say. I don't necessarily need to agree with that. But it's his right.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000003963922.jpg><h2>Friendships that look a little cosy</h2><p>Novak and Jelena were young sweethearts, meeting at high school in 2005 and getting engaged in 2013.</p><p>She's spoken about how they made things work when they were young, admitting their romance felt like "mission impossible" when she worked with an oil company in Monte Carlo while he played professional tennis.</p><p>Eventually things got too hard and she jacked the job in to join Novak on tour - but rumours soon began to swirl around the couple.</p><p>The tennis star's friendship with Serbian pop star Natasa Bekvalac was first questioned in 2011, with speculation continuing for five more years - especially when they were both seen in Ibiza on separate holidays over the same summer.</p><p>She has always denied any hint of an affair, but that hasn't stopped rumours.</p><p>There was also speculation about a blonde lawyer from the Ukraine, named only as Victoria, whose Instagram feed showed that she followed him wherever in the world he played.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000507901330.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000507899295.jpg><p>Then there was his ex-girlfriend DJ Lady Lee - Serbia’s highest paid female DJ, real name Lidija Popovic - who discussed their continuing platonic “emotional bond.”</p><p>She was quick to shoot down rumours there was anything untoward going on between them though.</p><p>Things died down a bit around the time of Novak and Jelena's wedding, which took place in July 2014 - just a couple of months after they confirmed they were having their first baby.</p><p>Stefan was born that October, with daughter Tara following in three years later.</p><p>Having young kids has kept Jelena busy, but it's not all she does.</p><p>She is the director of the couple's charity the Novak Djokovic Foundation, which aims to help children in Serbia realise their dreams by improving the country's education system.</p><p>The couple still find time to go out though, with both documenting their personal lives on social media.</p><h2>Bollywood and bickering</h2><p>In fact, Novak was seen out in March 2016 with Bollywood actress Deepika Padukone, known as Dippy. The pair were observed leaving The Nice Guy bar in Los Angeles together in a black chauffeur-driven car.</p><p>He later explained that Dippy was a friend of his wife, although Jelena was not there.</p><p>It didn’t help his case that Natasa Bekvalac waded in and, according to multiple reports, even suggested, “Novak would be happier dating Deepika Padukone.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000368056503.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000507899244.jpg><p>As these rumours swirled, Jelena seemed unfazed. Her Instagram feed of 470K followers at the time frequently showed happy pictures of the couple together sharing "#family time" – on holidays, at events, cuddling up to their then baby son.</p><p>The only post that eluded to her struggles was in January 2016 when she posted the Carrie Fisher quote with the hashtag #stopcyberbullying: “Resentment is like drinking poison and waiting for the other person to die.</p><p>"I always try hard and give my best to understand the other side of the story before I judge... With the social media, it is quite hard to tune out all the voices.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000507898365.jpg><p>But it can’t have been fun to see the photos that Serena and Venus Williams' beautiful chef, <a href=#>Lauren Von Der Pool, shared of her and Novak on her Instagram page</a>, especially the one from 2012 when she had her arm draped around him at a party.</p><p>Another showed the chef staring up at the Wimbledon champion at the Miami Open in 2015 with the caption: "When world no 1 @djokernole is your fan lol! Not to be bragadoscious but I'm kinda a big deal."</p><p>She's also posted pictures of them pair partying in Australia - but has steadfastly denied anything romantic between them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000337263395.jpg><p>That said, trouble seemed to be brewing at the US Open in 2016, when Jelena appeared stony faced.</p><p>Footage of the couple bickering over a Facebook video released in February 2017 only reinforced the impression that relationship was strained - he chided her for the angle at which she shot the footage of him training, and she bitterly asked where his manners were, adding: "'Thank you love, thank you.' Isn't that the way to say it?"</p><p>It was around this time that Novak's on court performance suffered too.</p><p>He went from winning four major tournaments in a row, to being beaten in the third round at Wimbledon in 2016.</p><p>His No. 1 ranking fell that November, then he lost in the first round at the Olympics and in the second round at the Australian Open.</p><p>He only made it to the quarter-finals at the French Open in 2017 and looked miserable and jittery thoughout.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Novak Djokovic's wife Jelena tells him off in Facebook live</span><p>“It was nothing physical,” he said, in the clearest explanation he ever offered for his wipeout. “It was some other things that I was going through privately.”</p><p>Then, of course, came the infamous McEnroe quotes - although Novak simply swept them aside, with Jelena not commenting at all.</p><p>Preferring to leave the speeches to her husband, Jelena instead uses social media to make her mark.</p><p>She appears to have been with her husband in the UK during the recent Wimbledon tournament, with photo of her kids tagged 'Wimbledon' and uploaded to Instagram earlier this month.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN SPORT</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000507895678.jpg><p>And so despite Jelena missing her husband's tennis triumph this year, the couple seem very much together.</p><p>Only two days ago, Novak posted a video of the couple in Croatia, where they are on vacation, singing along to some local music.</p><p>With her arm draped around his shoulders, the pair seemed relaxed and happy.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Novak Djokovic speaks about his childhood dream of winning Wimbledon in front of his family in post-match interview</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZIZ2gpJpcGlnnqTDoreMnaGoo5%2BrtqR5zJqpq6GRnLJutsSlnKeZXay2p7GMoqWfoZSauarA2GaprqWfqr%2B0ew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnovak-djokovic-marriage-jelena-wife-infidelity-rumours.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnovak-djokovic-marriage-jelena-wife-infidelity-rumours.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnovak-djokovic-marriage-jelena-wife-infidelity-rumours.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnovak-djokovic-marriage-jelena-wife-infidelity-rumours.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnovak-djokovic-marriage-jelena-wife-infidelity-rumours.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnovak-djokovic-marriage-jelena-wife-infidelity-rumours.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./love-is-blinds-danielle-ruhl-did-trauma-therapy-amid-divorce.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./love-is-blinds-danielle-ruhl-did-trauma-therapy-amid-divorce.html>Love Is Blinds Danielle Ruhl Did Trauma Therapy Amid Divorce</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./happy-national-cleavage-day-from-kim-kardashian-and-kompany.html>Happy National Cleavage Day from Kim Kardashian and Kompany!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./happy-national-cleavage-day-from-kim-kardashian-and-kompany.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
