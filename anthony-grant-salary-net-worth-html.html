The Dayton University alum, who is also the head coach for his alma mater, has gone from being fired from a high-profile college coaching job to winning every national coach of the year award — all in a matter of five years.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>His journey serves as a gentle reminder that rough patches in life are only temporary. His ability to overcome the ebbs and flows in his career has endowed him to be in the receiving end of a massive salary.&nbsp;</p><h2>Grant has Received Five Coach of The Year Awards this Season</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Grant and his team, the Dayton Flyers, have been nothing short of legendary this season (2020) with a school-best 29-2 record as of 20th October 2020. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>&nbsp;The college team is&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">currently</a>&nbsp;No. 3 in national ranking and has a perfect and unprecedented 18-0 record in the Atlantic 10 Conference.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Anthony Grant with the Dayton Flyers </strong>(Photo Source: Facebook)<span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Not just that, the team had the nation's best 20-game winning streak that might have kept going if it wasn't for the global pandemic. As the gyms shut down and the basketball courts emptied, Grant, his wife, and their four kids headed home to Bellbrook.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite being off-the-field, it did not stop his admirers from finding him. He has been awarded the title of the coach of the year by the&nbsp;Associated Press, Sporting News, the U.S. Basketball Writers Association,&nbsp;and&nbsp;the National Association of Basketball Coaches.</p><p>He was recently&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">named</a>&nbsp;the prestigious&nbsp;Naismith Men's College Coach of the Year and became the third coach in the award's 34-year-long-history to win after being fired from a Division I job. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Grant was previously Fired From the University Of Alabama</h2><p>This breakout season did not come without the sting&nbsp;of past experiences.
