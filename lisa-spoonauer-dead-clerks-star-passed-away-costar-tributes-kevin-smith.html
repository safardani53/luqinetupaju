The Clerks star unexpectedly died on Saturday, May 20 after her family reportedly&nbsp;called 911 at 11:05pm, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>.&nbsp;Lisa was not breathing by the time law enforcement and EMTs arrived at her home in Jackson, New Jersey. Lisa’s family did not say what caused <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her death</a>, but a private <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>funeral has been planned for Saturday, May 27</a>. Lisa&nbsp;was survived by her husband <strong>Tom Carnon</strong>,&nbsp;their daughter <strong>Mia Spoonauer</strong>, and her stepson <strong>Tyler Caron</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Lisa starred in the cult classic&nbsp;Clerks&nbsp;as Caitlin Bree in 1994. She only was&nbsp;in one other movie called Bartender&nbsp;in 1997 before she left the acting business to have a career as&nbsp;a restaurant manager and event planner. She left a powerful impression&nbsp;on her Clerks costars. They shared their fondest memories of Lisa in a series of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>heartfelt posts on social media</a>. Clerks‘ writer and director <strong>Kevin Smith</strong>, 46, was in complete shock over the news. “Devastated to report that #LisaSpoonauer, who played Caitlin in #clerks, has passed away,” he wrote. He praised Lisa’s “natural and authentic voice” as an actress and said she absolutely “CRUSHED” her first scene with <strong>Brian O’Halloran</strong>, 47, in “one long take that still remains one of my favorite scenes I’ve ever shot.”</p><a href=# rel=nofollow readability=1><p>View this post on Instagram</p></a><p><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Devastated to report that #LisaSpoonauer, who played Caitlin in #clerks, has passed away. In 1992, I went looking for Lisa without knowing either who she was or the integral role she'd play in my life. I'd held a night of open auditions at the #firstavenueplayhouse (where we found @briancohalloran and @marilynghigliotti) but the perfect Caitlin Bree never walked through the door. So I popped into an acting class at Brookdale Community College and watched the students from the back. Lisa was easily the most natural and authentic voice in the room. She didn't sound like she was acting at all; she delivered scripted dialogue as if she was inventing her conversation in the moment, like people do in real life. Captivated, I approached Lisa cold in the parking lot after the class and said "This is gonna sound creepy but… Do you wanna be in a movie?" Fearlessly, she replied "Not if it's porn." I told her a bit about Clerks and gave her a copy of the script and my phone number. She called me a few days later and said "Well it's not porn, but everybody talks like it is. It's funny. I'll do it." A complete stranger at first, Lisa quickly became one of the most important people I'd ever meet when she joined Brian, #JeffAnderson, Marilyn, @jaymewes, @samosier, @davidkleinasc and me as one of the chief architects of my first film. We rehearsed for a month straight in the store after hours, where Lisa perfected Caitlin (and fell in love with Jeff). The first night of the shoot, Lisa had to maneuver her way through a seven minute scene with Brian in the video store, when Caitlin finally shows up in the movie. Lisa and Brian CRUSHED it in one long take that still remains one of my favorite scenes I've ever shot – not because it shows off any directorial flare (it doesn't) but because it exemplified how great the performers were since we never had to cut away from their 2-shot. But as strong an actress as she was, Lisa was an even more excellent Mother to her daughter Mia. Whenever we'd Facebook later in life, she'd gush about her baby girl proudly. My heart goes out to Tom, Mia and Lisa's family. Thank you for dreaming my dream with me. You changed my life, Lisa.</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kevin Smith</a> (@thatkevinsmith) on May 23, 2017 at 2:32pm PDT</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Kevin shared a hilarious story about how he asked Lisa to be a part of Clerks when he walked up to her after an acting class. “I approached Lisa cold in the parking lot after the class and said ‘This is gonna sound creepy but… Do you wanna be in a movie?’ Fearlessly, she replied ‘Not if it’s porn,'” he wrote.&nbsp;<strong>Marilyn Ghigliotti</strong>, 55, said she was “heartbroken” to learn about Lisa. “I was blessed to have gotten to share an experience with her and the rest of the Clerks family that cannot be measured and will always be remembered.”&nbsp;Brian shared his own thoughts about Lisa and wrote, “not a day goes by that she was mentioned or remembered in some fashion.” He added, “she will live on in my heart and in the hearts of millions. Always in my heart. Rest in Peace Lisa.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, send your thoughts to Lisa’s family and friends in the comments below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlnZH12e5FtZqWho5Z6tLzOqKWarZWneqWxwJ1knKSVp7i0edKtmKtloJbAtLHDZpiwmalisLC%2F05qpZqyinq%2B2wMSsZKSdpp67br%2FMoquhZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flisa-spoonauer-dead-clerks-star-passed-away-costar-tributes-kevin-smith.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flisa-spoonauer-dead-clerks-star-passed-away-costar-tributes-kevin-smith.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flisa-spoonauer-dead-clerks-star-passed-away-costar-tributes-kevin-smith.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flisa-spoonauer-dead-clerks-star-passed-away-costar-tributes-kevin-smith.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flisa-spoonauer-dead-clerks-star-passed-away-costar-tributes-kevin-smith.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flisa-spoonauer-dead-clerks-star-passed-away-costar-tributes-kevin-smith.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lauren-hutton-used-morticians-wax-to-cover-her-gap-tooth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lauren-hutton-used-morticians-wax-to-cover-her-gap-tooth.html>Lauren Hutton Reveals How She Hid Her Gap Tooth on Her Early Vogue Covers: 'Mortician's Wax'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./les-wexner-now.html>A New Hulu Show About Victoria's Secret Has Viewers Wondering About Les Wexner</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./les-wexner-now.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
