<time>06 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>There is no doubt that Real Madrid is the most powerful football club in the world. They are unrivaled in terms of European success, having won the European Cup and Champions League more than any other team in history.</p><p>The club has produced some of the greatest players of all time, including Alfredo Di Stefano, Ferenc Puskas, Raul, Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, and Cristiano Ronaldo.</p><p>Indeed, under president Florentino Perez’s leadership, the club became famous for attempting to attract the world’s most prominent and most marketable footballers through their ‘Galactico’ policy.</p><p>Real Madrid has rarely had a losing streak, and when they have, it has been brief, which is why many players have been desperate to play at the Santiago Bernabeu. However, some big names have come close, only for deals to fall through.</p><h2>Number 5: Totti</h2><p><strong>Francesco Totti</strong> was a one-club man, spending his entire career with his beloved Roma.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Totti.jpg><p>Though he would have undoubtedly won more trophies if he had moved elsewhere, his devotion to the capital club would see him repeatedly renew his contract to remain and become the Giallorossi’s greatest legend.</p><p>However, only one club could have enticed him away – Real Madrid, and a transfer came close in 2006.</p><p>“The only other team I could have gone to play for was Real Madrid.” “According to the World Cup winner, told the Guardian.</p><p>“I believe it was the only possible team. A trip to a different country could have been a wonderful experience for everyone.</p><p>“For my family’s sake. “As for me…”</p><h2>Number 4: Patrick Vieira</h2><p><strong>Patrick Vieira</strong> was coming off one of the most impressive club seasons in English football history with Arsenal in the summer of 2004.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Patrick-Vieira.jpg><p>The Gunners won the title after going unbeaten in their ‘Invincible’ campaign, with Vieira playing a pivotal role in midfield.</p><p>According to the player, Real Madrid was desperate to sign him, and a deal came close only to be pulled at the last minute.</p><p>“The year before I left, I was close to leaving for Madrid,” he said.</p><p>“The agreement was reached between the two clubs, and when the time came for me to leave, I changed my mind because I believed I wanted to stay at Arsenal and finish my career there.</p><p>“I didn’t see any reason to leave, and I’m not sure if it was a lack of courage.</p><p>“If I had known I was leaving the following year, I would have gone to Madrid.”</p><h2>Number 3: David De Gea</h2><p><strong>David de Gea</strong> may have burst onto the scene at Atletico Madrid before joining Manchester United, but that didn’t stop him from pursuing a move to rivals Real Madrid while at Old Trafford.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/David-de-Gea.jpg><p>The transfer seemed unavoidable with the Spaniard returning to La Liga. It came within minutes of happening in the summer of 2015 – only for technology to get in the way. A faulty fax machine allegedly prevented paperwork from being processed in time.</p><p>As a result, De Gea did not get his wish, even though he has since signed a lucrative extension with Manchester United.</p><p>After the deal fell through, he told the Mail that he was worried about the reaction he would get from United fans if he played.</p><p>“I was unsure how Old Trafford would react to my presence.</p><p>“I was nervous as I walked out that day. They’ve always been there for me, but I had a moment of doubt that day. They were incredible, as it turned out. Everyone was singing my name. It was crucial to me.”</p><h2>Number 2: Neymar</h2><p>Real Madrid made several attempts to sign <strong>Neymar</strong> while at Santos, PSG, and even Barcelona.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/nn.jpeg><p>It appeared to be a match made in heaven: the Brazilian was emerging as the world’s next global football superstar, trailing only Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, and Real Madrid wanted him to be the face of a few teams.</p><p>Madrid’s fascination with Neymar dates back to when he was 14 years old when he had a trial with the club.</p><p>Despite the club’s desperate desire to complete the transaction, Neymar’s father chose to keep his son at home to grow up in Brazil before moving to Europe.</p><p>Over the past few years, Neymar has allegedly been the subject of massive money bids from Real Madrid, with reported fees ranging from €150m to €300m.</p><p>It seemed inevitable for a time, but he recently signed a lucrative new contract with PSG, likely ending any further speculation.</p><h2>Number 1: Lewandowski</h2><p>Perez approached <strong>Robert Lewandowski</strong> moments after he helped knock Real Madrid out of the Champions League with a spectacular performance at the Santiago Bernabeu, where he scored four goals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/lewa.jpg><p>The Real Madrid chairman pleaded with him to join Dortmund, but Lewandowski had already agreed to join Bayern Munich that summer.</p><p>According to Marca, when Cristiano Ronaldo left for Juventus a few years later, there were more talks between the Poland international and Madrid.</p><p>Bayern, on the other hand, refused to let Lewandowski go. However, this is the only deal on our list that could still happen. However, the superstar forward is getting on in years, so it would have to happen soon.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirqKhdanqxuMCynKurXay1sHnApaSoq6Rit7C1zZ6bZqqVlrluucCdqaKcXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftop-5-players-who-almost-joined-real-madrid.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftop-5-players-who-almost-joined-real-madrid.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftop-5-players-who-almost-joined-real-madrid.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftop-5-players-who-almost-joined-real-madrid.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftop-5-players-who-almost-joined-real-madrid.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftop-5-players-who-almost-joined-real-madrid.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./gina-torress-husband-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./gina-torress-husband-list.html>Who is Gina Torres Dating Gina Torres's Husband &amp;amp; Exes</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./pua-magasiva-dies-power-rangers-star-was-only-38.html>Pua Magasiva Dies; Power Rangers Star Was Only 38</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./pua-magasiva-dies-power-rangers-star-was-only-38.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
