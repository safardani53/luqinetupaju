<time>10 Mar 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>ANJI Nyquist has lived the American dream by winning on Jeopardy! after being a lifelong watcher last week.</p><p>Anji told U.S. Sun about her experience and the key host attribute that puts <a href=#>Ken Jennings</a> head and shoulders above <a href=#>Mayim Bialik</a> so far.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/champ-anji-nyquist-reveals-ken-831770957.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/7882d5f6-1ace-40b3-bd27-ba914dc7e90d.jpg><p><a href=#>Anji</a>, a&nbsp;Minnesota-based social media coordinator, won July 5's <a href=#>Jeopardy!</a>&nbsp;episode in a moment that even surprised her.</p><p>She lept from third place to the new champ by being the only one correct on&nbsp;<a href=#>Final Jeopardy.</a></p><p>The clue read: "Nicknamed 'the kingdom in the sky,' this landlocked nation is the only country in the world to lie entirely above 4,000 feet."</p><p>Anji was the only one who could map out "Lesotho," earning her $8800 and a priceless reaction when declared a winner, seen above.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more Jeopardy! interviews">Read more Jeopardy! interviews</h2><p>Anji&nbsp;<a href=#>exclusively</a>&nbsp;told The U.S. Sun that feeling was: “Amazing, I was as shocked as I looked. I was not expecting to win."</p><p>Though Anji lost&nbsp;one game later, she won over the masses by revealing in her second interview with&nbsp;<a href=#>Ken</a>, 49, that her cat is named NAZ REID (in all caps) after the underrated Timberwolves player.</p><p>“The whole Naz Reid thing blew up," Anji shared. "That’s been the most fun part of this.</p><p>"We filmed this in May, and Naz Reid just signed a big contract, so there was a lot of Naz Reid news the week my episode aired.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>"If you're a Naz Reid fan, you're a Naz Reid fan all year.”</p><h2>'HE MAKES THE SHOW MORE ENJOYABLE'</h2><p>Speaking of fandom, Anji, like many Jeopardy! devotees, is team Ken after being a religious watcher.</p><p>She shared: “I love Ken Jennings because I watched his whole run on Jeopardy! back in the day," referring to his still-unsurpassed 74-game $2.52M streak in 2004.</p><p>"I mean, how many people from Jeopardy! do you know the name of?</p><p>"He’s Mr. Jeopardy! and he does such a great job, it’s hard to compare anybody else to him.</p><p>“<a href=#>Mayim</a> does a great job [too], but Ken understands the game a little more and is naturally a better host.</p><p>"They’re both great, but I'm glad he ended up hosting my episodes.</p><p>“She does a great job, and I'm sure she’ll get better over time.</p><p>"[But] Ken’s used to it.</p><p>"He's been a contestant, and he kind of gets it.</p><p>"He adds comments about the actual game as it's going on.</p><p>"He’ll let us know who's in the lead, who’s going first in <a href=#>Double Jeopardy.</a></p><p>"He adds in his own narrative, which I think makes the show a little more enjoyable.</p><p>"But I'm sure Mayim will pick that up over time. It’s probably just something you learn."</p><p>A recent Twitter user summed up the difference similarly, writing: "Another thing I enjoy about Ken is that when it comes to revealing the correct response for Final Jeopardy, he doesn’t just say it and then leave it, but rather gives a fun little story about the facts of it."</p><p>Some fans have noticed that Mayim struggles to buzz in with the same level of awareness- people have even snarked that <a href=#>her interview rapport is stilted</a>, not to mention her <a href=#>so-called pauses</a> when ruling.</p><p>Anji did admit: "It is not easy to host a show like that, especially after <a href=#>Alex Trebek</a>, who was such a professional.</p><p>"When he passed, I was like, 'Will they ever find someone as good as him?' - and they won't find anybody.</p><p>"I don't think you can hold a candle to him, no offense to Ken or Mayim.</p><p>"[But] Jeopardy! is as fun as big as it was, and they ushered it into a new era."</p><p>Mayim, 47, and winningest contestant&nbsp;Ken&nbsp;were chosen as the co-successors to the late&nbsp;Alex&nbsp;in 2022 after his tragic passing at age 80.</p><p>Not only has viewership thrived with 20M weekly watchers but both scored <a href=#>Emmy nominations</a> this week for <a href=#>Outstanding Game Show Host</a> just one year in.</p><h2>'BRING A LAYER'</h2><p>Anji first auditioned in July 2022 and has been watching the beloved&nbsp;<a href=#>game show</a>&nbsp;since she was 13.</p><p>Anji advised future contestants: “It’s so cold in that studio, and I'm always cold.</p><p>“They warn you that it's cold, but it's so cold. Bring something warm to wear even when you're not on stage.</p><p>"That’s some advice I'd give- <a href=#>your shirt</a> might be pretty but layer up.</p><p>“The stage is so much smaller than I was expecting. The board and contestants aren't that far apart. Once you win, you're not that far from Ken."</p><p>Anji also scored some fond memories from sticking around for her entire tape day- or five episodes.</p><p>"While on set, I joked with a producer Jimmy [Maguire], about them starting up the <a href=#>Clue Crew</a> again with me on it," she revealed.</p><p>“The whole day was so exciting. My [tape day] group was so great, we all have a group chat still going, and I don’t feel like that happens a lot."</p><p>To study up, Anji: “Made some flashcards of planets, got a big kids book on the presidents, classic lit, opera, and I have a few old Jeopardy! board games, so I was going through the card decks of those with my boyfriend.”</p><p>"All in all, it was about a year from when I took the test to when my episode aired," which entailed<a href=#> three different Zoom auditions.</a></p><p>"For some people, it goes a little quicker - but people also try for a long time."</p><h2>THOUGHTS ON TOMMY JOHN DAILY DOUBLE</h2><p>A few episodes after Anji's two games, two-day winner Alex Gordon, who had scored two runaway victories, lost in a wild fashion.</p><p>The Somers, New York medical student&nbsp;<a href=#>botched his chances of winning by missing a $12,000 surgical Daily Double</a>.</p><p>Some fans were bothered by Ken's commentary in that moment.</p><p>He urged Alex with just five clues left on the board: "How confident are you in a medical category, Alex?"</p><p>Alex then bet an unusually sizable amount towards the tail end of the game, sealing his fate.</p><p>Anji shared: "I did see that Tommy John Daily Double."</p><p>"I knew right away, but you don't know if you're gonna know. It was a bummer for him.</p><p>"But that's what Jeopardy! is. And I almost didn't win, I only won right at the end."</p><p>"I think the reaction [to blame Ken] was overdramatized.</p><p>"Ken has no stake in who wins. It's Jeopardy! and he just wants to see a good game, and that is part of it.</p><p>"I'm sure Alex was probably in his head, 'this is a category I'm confident in, so let's go with my gut and wager a lot.'</p><p>"If I were a med student and it was a medical sort of question, I would have done the same thing."</p><p>Though when reminded there were only five clues left when Alex chose to go with a $12,000 bet, Anji did relent, "I guess you're right, but that's Jeopardy!."</p><h2>'SPECIAL MEMORY'</h2><p>Anji also opened up about why Jeopardy! means so much to her with a moving story that involves Ken's rival James Holzhauer.</p><p>“Before my dad passed away, I lived with him and took care of him when he had dementia.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"We would watch together when&nbsp;<a href=#>James Holzahuer</a>&nbsp;was on his run," referring to the poker pro and&nbsp;<a href=#>Masters winner's</a>&nbsp;monster 32-day streak in 2019.</p><p>“My dad would do the ‘all in’ motion with James, and he would cheer when he got them right, so that's a special memory for me.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/bc723a76-0a81-4726-9d83-73541c03a831.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/champ-anji-nyquist-reveals-ken-831770963.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/guest-star-ken-jennings-mayim-804098684-2.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwZmWAdn6XaKGep6CWv6XFjJqlo6Fdo8aywcisq2ajlaN6q7HNp6Cnn6Nir6bA056pZqCfqMFw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjeopardy-anji-nyquist-ken-jennings-better-host.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjeopardy-anji-nyquist-ken-jennings-better-host.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjeopardy-anji-nyquist-ken-jennings-better-host.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjeopardy-anji-nyquist-ken-jennings-better-host.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjeopardy-anji-nyquist-ken-jennings-better-host.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjeopardy-anji-nyquist-ken-jennings-better-host.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./victoria-beckham-david-beckham-kids-family-christmas-photo-8419952.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./victoria-beckham-david-beckham-kids-family-christmas-photo-8419952.html>Victoria and David Beckham Pose for Christmas Photo with Their Kids</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./gmas-michael-strahan-taunts-a-list-guest-kart-race.html>GMA's Michael Strahan taunts A-list guest 'big boy, you're not leaving me!' during heated go-kart ra</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./gmas-michael-strahan-taunts-a-list-guest-kart-race.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
