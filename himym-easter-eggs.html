Instead, it looks more like us watching our favorite shows, for the one millionth time, and trying to find inside jokes, clues, and hidden messages on our newest marathon. And there are a few shows that had as many quality Easter Eggs as How I Met Your Mother. The show itself was full of inside jokes that we still reference today — so it’s no surprise that there were even more jokes and surprises hidden just below the surface.&nbsp;</p><p>So, how well do you think you know HIMYM? Check out our list of five of the craziest Easter Eggs we somehow missed to see if you caught 'em.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">&nbsp;1. Ted May Have Given the Mother’s Identity Away in Season 1&nbsp;</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: r/r</span></figure><p>No, we’re not kidding! In Season 1, Episode 9 — aka “Bell Full of Turkey” —&nbsp;Ted meets a stripper who introduces herself as Amber, before saying, “Actually, my name’s Tracy.” Future Ted jokes to his kids that that is the story of how he met their mother and the children freak out over the revelation that their mom was a stripper back in the day.&nbsp;</p><p>And, well, it turns out that they had just reason to freak out — given that their mom’s real name is also Tracy. Which basically means we should’ve known anyone not named Tracy was simply a decoy.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2. Conan O’Brien Had a Blink-and-You’ll-Miss-It Cameo&nbsp;</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: r/r</span></figure><p>Way back in Season 7, that is. Obviously, it should come as no surprise that a big Hollywood comedian could get a walk-on role on a hit TV show if he so desired (he had a great cameo on The Office too), but it’s more interesting once you learn about how Conan’s appearance on the show came to be.&nbsp;</p><p>As it turns out, Conan bid on — and won! — a walk-on role in the hit series as part of a charity auction. Originally, the co-creators said they were going to write a part for him, but eventually the talk show host convinced them not to.&nbsp;</p><p>“When we heard Conan had won the auction, we started going through all these ideas for what he could play,” co-showrunner Carter Bays said. “But then we heard back: ‘He just wants to be an extra.’ And we realized this was really the funniest version [of a cameo].”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. There’s Some Foreshadowing the First Time Ted Meets The Mother&nbsp;</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>When Ted first meets The Mother, the two of them are standing at a train station when a surprising song comes on — “The Funeral” by Band of Horses. What we realize now — but didn’t at the time — is that the song is probably foreshadowing Tracy’s tragic ending.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4. Barney and James Got Thematic Drinks Back in Moscow&nbsp;</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: r/r</span></figure><p>We’re talking about actual Moscow, though it does sound like the kind of club we’d come across in HIMYM’s version of New York City. During the Season 9 episode "Coming Back," we’re transported back in time, to 1807 Russia, to learn about the “Stinson Curse.”</p><p>There, we meet ancestors who look exactly like Barney and his brother-from-the-same-mother, James; their lookalike ancestors' drinks even seem to match their outside appearances, as "Barney" is seen enjoying a White Russian while "James" is sipping on a Black Russian.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5. Neil Patrick Harris Is Never Afraid to Poke Some Fun at Himself&nbsp;</h2><p>Now kids, what you may not realize is that before he was your Uncle Barney, Neil Patrick Harris was actually an incredibly successful child actor, after getting his start on Doogie Howser, M.D., which ran from 1989 to 1993. In the episode where Barney hires a family of paid actors to pretend to be his own family, he complains about the kid playing his son's acting chops and scoffs, “Call me crazy, but child actors were way better back in the ‘80s.”&nbsp;</p><p>The joke being, of course, that Barney himself was one of those talented child actors back in the ‘80s.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">More from Distractify</h2><p><a href=#>Can You Guess the Movie Title Based Off the Limerick to Describe Them?</a></p><p><a href=#>Here's Where Your Favorite Characters on 'Orange Is the New Black' Stand After Season 5</a></p><p><a href=#>This Reality Show Has Surprisingly Produced More Marriages Than 'The Bachelor'</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaJ2eqbKzwMCipaadnql8c3yQcWZpcF9lfnC%2Bx6Rpm2eYnrq6uYyemKyslad6prPGrGQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhimym-easter-eggs.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhimym-easter-eggs.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhimym-easter-eggs.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhimym-easter-eggs.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhimym-easter-eggs.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhimym-easter-eggs.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-anthony-harris-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-anthony-harris-dating.html>Who is Anthony Harris Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./maci-bookout-ryan-edwards-is-definitely-back-on-drugs.html>Maci Bookout: Ryan Edwards is DEFINITELY Back on Drugs!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./maci-bookout-ryan-edwards-is-definitely-back-on-drugs.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
