I was in a good place mentally," he reflects, "and I knew I had a lot of tough players to beat and I felt like if I could just control my emotions well, and I could play how I had played the day prior — or at least remotely like that — then I felt like I would have a chance."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Mentality is crucial, he says of keeping his emotions and frustration at bay during the final 18.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There was an ease that I had when I was out there playing and, at least in tough times, I've noticed that it's very easy to get worked up when you get in the moment and have a chance to win a tournament," the Kentucky native explains. "I felt like that was going to be key for me on Sunday. It helps that I played really well and didn't give myself too many chances to get upset, but, that was huge for me to stay patient and kind of stay in an even keel all day."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">What also helped? The return of fans. Spectators were allowed to attend the tournament at TPC Sawgrass in Florida, with the course at 20% capacity. The absence of in-person fans amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, was an adjustment, Thomas says, so it was nice to have them back last week.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I found it very, very difficult to get focused and kind of get into rounds without fans there," he reflects. "You get so accustomed to thousands and thousands of people following you on the weekend and loud roars and cheers and everything. And then all of a sudden when it's not there, it's kind of hard to find that energy."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Justin Thomas at the 2021 Players Championship.</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though the crowds were back, one tournament staple was noticeably absent: Thomas' pal Tiger Woods, who is recovering from a scary single-vehicle <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>rollover car crash</a> in California last month.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He's been good at staying in touch for the last week," Thomas says of the 45-year-old, who <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>announced his return home</a> from the hospital on Tuesday. "I've tried to check in on him pretty much daily. I know there are some days that are better than others, and he's busy and whatnot, but, even in the beginning when I know that he didn't have his phone, I at least wanted to just kind of text him and tell him I'm thinking about him."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Justin Thomas.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>David Rosenblum/Icon Sportswire via Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Thomas says he made it clear to Woods that the golfer was on everyone's minds, and that the dad of two returned the favor, watching from afar as Thomas dominated last weekend.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He just told me to be myself and to have control of my emotions and my mental game," he tells PEOPLE of Woods' advice for him at the Players. "And he knew that if I just kind of controlled everything and didn't let stuff bother me or get to me, then, you know, I was going to have a good chance to be able to get it done. And I was glad that it worked out that way."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another person Thomas knows would be proud? His late grandfather, former golfer and teaching pro Paul Thomas, who died last month at the age of 89.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He was so supportive," says Thomas. "At the same time, you know, him being the age — older people don't really have filters. And it's sometimes funny to hear him tell it like it was to me. So, I know he would tell me that, you know, I missed a bunch of putts and I could have won by six or seven, but he's proud of me. And, then again, at the same time, he'd tell me, 'Well, you know, get back to work and let's go get ready for Augusta.' So that's what we're going to do."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6OlvLPA0mihrquknrtuwMeopJqrXaS7bsPIp6WippdiwamxjKmjmrGVp8Bur8eapKmhn6PAqbXPZpinnF2ptaZ5wJ2topuVYrOztcSnm2asmZyys3nWqKadq12crrexjKGgpmWSmrOwvsShmKecXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjustin-thomas-on-winning-the-players-championship-and-the-advice-friend-tiger-woods-gave-him-beforehand.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjustin-thomas-on-winning-the-players-championship-and-the-advice-friend-tiger-woods-gave-him-beforehand.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjustin-thomas-on-winning-the-players-championship-and-the-advice-friend-tiger-woods-gave-him-beforehand.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjustin-thomas-on-winning-the-players-championship-and-the-advice-friend-tiger-woods-gave-him-beforehand.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjustin-thomas-on-winning-the-players-championship-and-the-advice-friend-tiger-woods-gave-him-beforehand.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjustin-thomas-on-winning-the-players-championship-and-the-advice-friend-tiger-woods-gave-him-beforehand.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./reginald-veljohnson-carl-winslow-gay-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./reginald-veljohnson-carl-winslow-gay-html.html>Know about 'Family Matters' star Reginald VelJohnson's Gay Rumors, Marital &amp;amp; Dating Status and Net W</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jane-hanson-19551209-html.html>Jane Hanson (TV Show Host) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jane-hanson-19551209-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
