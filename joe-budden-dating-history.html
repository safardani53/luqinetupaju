His stint as a rapper in the group Slaughterhouse and his many forays into the media have cemented him as a true pop culture personality. Joe has undeniably left an impact on the music scene today.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>With that being said, for however much fans and listeners might know about Joe's career and his opinions on many things, one thing that isn't always talked about is his dating history. So, who has Joe dated and what do we know about his romantic life overall?

To start, the earliest recorded relationship that Joe was in was when he was 20 and dating a girl named Angie. Her last name has never been disclosed, but she and Joe welcomed a son, Joseph Budden III (nicknamed Trey), on May 11, 2001.</p><p>The next major relationship that Joe was in was with former Love & Hip Hop: New York star Tahiry Jose. She and Joe started dating back in 2005, but their relationship had a bunch of rough patches. The couple broke up twice, and the second time they did, Tahiry revealed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Unlocked</a> that Joe assaulted her while they were together, breaking her rib and nose.</p><p>Joe categorically denied these allegations on multiple occasions.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In 2012, Joe met and began dating the next girl who caught his eye: Kaylin Garcia. Kaylin works as a model and also appeared on Love & Hip Hop: New York. Much like his last relationship, he and Kaylin's romance had plenty of rocky moments.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Reportedly, a lot of the discourse within their relationship came from the fact that Joe was not completely over Tahiry, which upset Kaylin. The two took part in an episode of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Couples Therapy With Dr. Jenn</a> to try to resolve it, but it never worked out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Just a few years later in 2016, Joe entered his next serious relationship. This time, he dated actress Cyn Santana. Things appeared to be going well for the couple initially, as they welcomed a son named Lexington on Dec. 15, 2017, and Joe proposed to Cyn less than a year later.</p><p>However, their engagement didn't last long as Cyn, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BET</a>, called it off after four months.</p><p>Cyn accused Joe of poor parenting and physical abuse in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">leaked phone conversation</a> from September 2020. She further claimed, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HotNewHipHop</a>, that Joe shouldn't be given custody of their child due to allegations that he kissed his child on the lips, was verbally abusive to Lexington's babysitter, abused substances, and more.</p><p>Joe denied all of the claims levied against him at that time.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Fast forward, and Joe is now dating model Shadée Monique. The two were spotted at a pool party together, and she apparently joined him to celebrate his 39th birthday in Turks & Caicos in August 2019.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While neither of the two decided to go public on social media during the early days of their relationship, Joe somewhat insinuated that they're together in June 2021 when he posted a minuscule photo of what appears to be the two of them on his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">story</a> with the caption, "Since she say I don't post us."</p><p>Now, it appears that the couple is ready to share their love with the world. In a July 18, 2022, Instagram post, Shadée shared a touching anniversary tribute to celebrate her and Joe's three-year milestone. The post, which included a slew of adorable shots of the couple, included a caption that addressed the couple going through their share of ups and downs. However, it's clear that both Joe and Shadée are committed to one another.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"Happy Anniversary baby. … Three years down and a lifetime to go. A few ups and downs and break ups to make ups … but we are here stronger and more in love than ever! We did it Joe!!! You’re not only my love but my best friend. … I love you Joseph Anthony Budden," Shadée wrote.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did Joe's relationship with Shadée Monique overlap with Cyn Santana?</h2><p>Did Joe's current relationship with Shadée Monique overlap with his ex-fiancée, Cyn Santana? Many eagle-eyed fans pointed out that Joe and Shadée are currently celebrating three years of love, and that three years ago, Joe and Cyn may have still been dating.</p><p>But Cyn and Joe broke up in spring 2019. Joe and Shadée were first spotted flirting with one another in August 2019 at his annual pool party, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AceShowbiz</a>. So, it's safe to say that Joe and Shadée likely started dating after he and Cyn went their separate ways.</p><p>Cheers to the lovebirds on celebrating three years of coupledom!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7ymecGum52dnmKxosDIp55moJmowbC%2B2A%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjoe-budden-dating-history.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjoe-budden-dating-history.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjoe-budden-dating-history.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjoe-budden-dating-history.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjoe-budden-dating-history.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjoe-budden-dating-history.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./why-do-people-hate-disney-wish.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./why-do-people-hate-disney-wish.html>Why Do People Hate Disney's Wish?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-larkins-viewers-say-same-thing-bradley-walsh-returns.html>The Larkins viewers all say the same thing as Bradley Walsh series returns</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-larkins-viewers-say-same-thing-bradley-walsh-returns.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
