Drake was named after the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Drake Hotel</a> in New York City, where the couple went on their honeymoon.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Drake, who has taken <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>an interest in baseball</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>watersports</a>, appears to have a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>good sense of humor</a>, often joking around with his dad. Fans got a peek into <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>their father-son relationship</a> during Fixer Upper's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>final season</a> when Drake made a brief appearance on the show.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Did you think when you were on the mound, 'I wish I was as handsome as my dad?' " Chip asked Drake after watching his baseball game.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Uh, no, because it's already true," Drake quipped.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As Drake has grown up, Chip and Joanna have had to adjust to big life changes — like helping their eldest <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>get his driver's license</a>. "I was so excited leading up to it, and Jo was too, kind of," Chip shared with PEOPLE in 2021.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, the excitement for Joanna was short-lived: "Then we get this kid his license, and the first morning he goes to drive, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jo bawls her eyes out</a>. She was just devastated and wanted no part. She wants to hire him a chauffeur!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In August 2022, Joanna reflected on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sending her son off to college</a> in an essay for Magnolia Journal. "Soon, our oldest son, Drake, will be leaving home for college," she wrote. "In the grand scheme of heartbreaking things, this one comes with a lot of gratitude and excitement … But still, my first child is moving away, and our family dynamic will change because of it, and that can feel like a loss of its own."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Joanna Gaines Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Joanna <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>marked Drake's high school graduation</a> in May 2023 with an Instagram video showing pictures from her oldest's childhood.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It feels like just yesterday that we were cheering him on as he took his first steps," Joanna wrote in the caption, "but last weekend, as he walked across the stage to receive his high school diploma (!!) we were cheering him on as he took his first steps into a world beyond what he’s known."<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ella-gaines-17></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Ella Gaines, 17</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Joanna Gaines Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Chip and Joanna welcomed their first daughter, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Ella Rose</a>, on Oct. 20, 2006.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2019, when Ella was 13, Joanna shared that her daughter takes after her. "Ella is like me," she told PEOPLE. "I think she'll <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>follow in my footsteps</a> and have her hand in a lot of things. Right now she wants to cook, be a lead designer and have a donut truck."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ella has already forayed into the food industry, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>running a bakery</a> from the family's kitchen. "Her new summer business is selling baked goods at the office when she goes to work with me," Joanna wrote on Instagram in 2018. "Tonight we stayed up late and she made Aunt Opal's banana pudding and the chocolate chip cookies from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>my cookbook</a>."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The now-teenager also appears to have a green thumb. During an episode of Fixer Upper, Ella and her younger sister Emmie helped Joanna <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>tend their backyard rose garden</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I love teaching the girls about what all goes into gardening, but I would say my favorite part about it is just getting to spend some time with them," Joanna said on the episode.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In October 2022, Ella <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>turned 16 years old</a> and got her driver's license. The proud mom was emotional about the milestone birthday, writing alongside <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>a video</a> of their house decorated for the occasion, "My sweet girl turns 16.

She and her brother Duke sell produce and eggs door-to-door and have even <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>asked their parents for a farm truck</a> for the business.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We printed labels for them, and once a week they go out and sell," Joanna told PEOPLE in 2019. "They're just like Chip: They don't take no for an answer!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And with her big sister, Emmie is in charge of caring for the chickens on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>their family farm</a>, something dad Chip is "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>really proud</a>" of.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-81 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We've got some baby chickens that Ella and Emmie are responsible for growing up to mature chickens," he said on an episode of Fixer Upper.

"She was determined to make up her own cookie recipe and I left the kitchen so she could surprise me (and so i wouldn't micromanage her work in the kitchen😅).

"The Gaines crew is now 1 stronger!" he wrote. "10 beautiful toes and 10 beautiful fingers all accounted for, and big momma is doing great!" Crew's name is a break with tradition, as his older brothers both have names starting with "D."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-91 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the age gap, Crew and his older siblings are very close. "I think it's sweet because they're older now, and I can see them wanting to be a part of this," Joanna told PEOPLE shortly after Crew's birth. "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>We're all rallying around this baby</a>, which I feel is a sweet gift to our family."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-93 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Crew's energy has also given Joanna a new perspective on life.
