Per <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a>, Erica is now claiming that she was “never a victim of sexual harassment or sexual abuse &nbsp;at the hands of Tiger Woods.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>According to court documents obtained by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The NY Post </a>for a July 18, 2023 report, Erica dismissed the case and it’s no longer pending. However, the case over her 2017 non-disclosure agreement with the golf star is reportedly still pending.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Erica previously <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>accused him of sexual harassment</a> in a filing for the lawsuit against the pro golfer. In court documents previously obtained by <strong>Hollywood Life, </strong>she claimed that Tiger “decided to pursue a sexual relationship” with her after she was hired at his restaurant in South Florida. She had been employed as a manager at The Woods Jupiter since 2015, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>. “A boss imposing different work conditions on his employee because of their sexual relationship is sexual harassment,” her lawyer said in the documents.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The court documents emerged two months after Erica <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>claimed in a lawsuit </a>filed in March 2023 that he owed her the $30 million for locking her out of his home during an apparent October 2022 breakup. The complaint followed the news that Erica reportedly filed to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>nullify a non-disclosure agreement</a> from her world-famous boyfriend. Shortly after the filings, it was reported that <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the pair had split,</a> despite the fact that the supportive former restaurant manager had previously rushed to his bedside<strong>&nbsp;</strong>following the golf superstar’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>harrowing rollover SUV crash</a> on Feb. 23, 2021, that left him hospitalized.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Erica showed how she has been part of Tiger’s family <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>at the PNC Tournament</a> back in 2020, supporting the golfing legend and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>his son</a>, <strong>Charlie</strong>. Erica joined Tiger’s ex-wife and Charlie’s mom,&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Elin Nordegren</a>, </strong>at the event, where they watched on as the father-son duo took the green. Erica has also spent time with the former couple’s daughter, <strong>Sam</strong>. Tiger and Erica appeared to be just as strong as ever in the years leading up to the recent bombshell news.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>As the legal battle shifts, learn more about Erica Herman with the five facts below.</p><h2>How Long Were Tiger & Erica Together?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Tiger and Erica <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>began dating in 2017</a>, and they met through work! Erica used to manage one of Tiger’s restaurants back in Florida, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Golf.com</a>. Their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first public appearance</a> was at the President’s Cup in 2017, in which Erica rocked a bright red polo and khaki shorts to the tournament in Jersey City, NJ.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>But five years into their seemingly low-key relationship, on March 8, 2023, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Page Six</a> reported that she filed to have her non-disclosure agreement from the pro golfer nullified — raising a red flag that the relationship was headed toward a rapid end. Per the outlet, she also sought to better understand whether the current NDA is “valid or enforceable,” and cited two federal laws that allow for nullification of an NDA if sexual assault or harassment claims were raised.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Masters Champions Dinner quarantine style.

Erica also cheered on Tiger at the 2017 President’s Cup, as well as at the 2018 Ryder Cup.
