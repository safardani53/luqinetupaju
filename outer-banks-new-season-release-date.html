I’m just hoping that we get a chance to actually tell those stories.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>In February 2023, Pate also said that season 4 was going to be the start of some new adventures for the beloved cast, <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">telling Netflix</a>: "We felt like we needed to migrate them out of school."</p><p>"We think about the first three [seasons] as a trilogy and then we’re starting over on [another sort of] trilogy now."</p><p>He added: “We just needed to clear the decks. We’re going to have new villains, a new treasure hunt, a new life situation.”</p><p>Pate also confirmed that fans can expect to see some flashbacks to what happened to their favorite Pogues and Kooks before the time jump ahead of the season 3 finale.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What did Chase Stokes say about season 4 spoilers?</h2><p>Filming for the fourth season is happening now in <a href=#>North Carolina</a>.</p><p>Outer Banks season four officially resumed production on November 20, 2023, in Wilmington.</p><p>The show was <a href=#>previously filmed</a> in Charleston, <a href=#>South Carolina</a>.</p><p>The show's season three finale hinted at a new adventure for the Pogues, one involving Blackbeard's treasure.</p><p>Blackbeard historically sailed in the North Carolina region.</p><p>On November 25, 2023, John B actor <a href=#>Chase Stokes</a> posted two photos to his Instagram grid, <a href=# aria-label="captioning the post (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">captioning the post</a>: "alright wake up john b let's go ole pal," sparking a social media frenzy.</p><p>Fans were ecstatic to finally get confirmation that production on their favorite action-adventure <a href=#>TV show</a> was underway, with the post quickly hitting over 1 million likes.</p><p>One user commented: "bring it on home john b.!" referencing a quote from the teen drama series.</p><p>Another said: "oh the scream i just scrumpt."</p><p>One fan even commented: "the way I just screamed SEASON 4 LETS GOO."</p><p>However, just days later, Stokes took to <a href=#>Instagram</a> to ask fans to respect the filming process, and to avoid posting spoilers on their <a href=#>social media</a>.</p><p>“We are about to embark on our journey and I feel like I shouldn’t have to say this, but please for the love of God don’t post spoilers,” he said in an <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram </a><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>s</a><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tory video</a>.</p><p>“I love the fact that everybody likes to show up and take pictures and videos, but if you feel like it’s something you probably shouldn’t post, don’t do it.”</p><p>“We really appreciate you showing up and continuing to love the show like it’s your own, but let’s just try our best this year to not post things that reveal plot and ruin the experience for others around the world,” he added.</p><p>Spoilers may be inevitable in this day and age, but it's refreshing to see cast members speak out and set limits for fans on set.</p><p>Still, despite photos and videos from season four already making their way online, it's evident that the upcoming season will be one to watch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

that the upcoming season's future storylines will differ from earlier seasons.</p><p>He said: “Things will be slowing down in season 4 and you will see a lot more of the Pogues in the future."</p><p>“It’s going to be more like season 1 because it won’t be as hectic as the last two seasons and there will be a lot of reflecting about what happened in [past seasons].”</p><p>No matter what season four has in store, fans will have to hold out just a little while longer, with the series set to premiere on Netflix in mid-2024.</p><p>Season one premiered back in April 2020, while the
