<time>16 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>In football, Adam Thielen is a superstar who became a starting receiver for his home-state team right out of college. However, to his wife Caitlin Thielen, he's just her Adam.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>But that does not mean she does not understand the gravitas of her husband's title. She&nbsp;told the <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Vikings News</a>,&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Even still, it doesn't seem [real sometimes] – to me, he's just Adam. But then when I stop to think about it, he is an NFL player. How cool is that? That's so awesome. People dream about that.</p><p><img alt="Adam Thielen with his wife Caitlin Thielen." height=556 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com/uploads/images/adam-thielen-wife-caitlin.jpg width=650 ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><strong>Adam&nbsp;Thielen with his wife Caitlin </strong><strong>Thielen. </strong>(Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p>Still, the truth is that throughout Adam's career, Caitlin has been a rock in his corner, and her support is unbelievable and unwavering. Adam said so himself.&nbsp;He also makes it a point to let his loving wife know how much she means to him.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>"I tell her all the time that I definitely wouldn't be here without her support," Adam said. "She lets me do the things that I need to do to be the best football player, the best husband [I can be]." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Adam Thielen's Wife Pushes Him to be the Best</h2><p>It's not just her support that Adam is&nbsp;grateful for, but also her competitive spirit. Caitlin is often more competitive than Adam is, which, as he claimed, was a hard thing to do.&nbsp;</p><p>While his wife's competitive spirit had helped him be the best he could be in the field, it made playing board games at home infinitely more difficult, Adam joked.&nbsp;</p><p>"She's probably one of my toughest critics … she knows the game just as well as I do," the&nbsp;Minnesota Vikings&nbsp;star added. "I'll get home and she's like, 'Man, what were you doing there? How come you didn't catch that one?'" <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The <a href=# rel=follow>NFL star</a>'s wife was not one to sugarcoat his shortcomings, making her one of his harshest critics, another quality he deeply appreciates.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>All that said, it's not just his spouse's love, support, and criticism that Adam has waiting for him at home. He has three adorable kids in his family.&nbsp;</p><h2>Adam Thielen's Family of Five</h2><p>Adam and Caitlin were a family of four with their two sons, Asher and Hudson, until 2020 Christmas when they announced they were expecting to have another baby.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Caitlin was the one to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">break the news</a> via her Instagram, where she shared a collage of Christmas-themed pictures with a special revelation.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><img alt="Adam Theilen spending family time with his wife Caitlin and children." height=678 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com/uploads/images/adam-thielen-family.jpg width=650 ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p><strong>Family Time: Adam spending time with his wife Caitlin and children. </strong>(Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The two&nbsp;Thielen brothers were dressed in sweaters with "Big Brother" printed across the torse as the two were holding the letters H & O in each hand — "Ho, Ho, Ho."</p><p>Well, the last picture in the collage wasn't the jolly "Ho," tho! Instead, it was an "Oh!" with the couple acting surprised. The second snap saw the whole family posing with the soon-to-be elder brothers, posing with their sister's sonogram reports.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>And on June 22, 2021, the&nbsp;Thielens became&nbsp;a family of five with the addition of the couple's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">youngest daughter,</a> Cora Hean&nbsp;Thielen. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>This time also,&nbsp;Caitlin shared the happy news on Instagram.
