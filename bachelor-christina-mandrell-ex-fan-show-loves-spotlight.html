They share a 5-year-old daughter, Blakely.</p><p>Blake said that he "wasn't surprised" when he learned about her signing on to the show.</p><p>He found out right before she was introduced to the 26-year-old tech exec from Anaheim Hills, California on <a href=#>The Bachelorette</a>'s After the Final Rose back in September, since she wanted her daughter to see her on TV.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Bachelor">Read More on The Bachelor</h2><p>"It seems like very much something Christina would do," Blake told The U.S. Sun, referring to her participating on the show.</p><p>"She definitely does [love being in the spotlight]. I mean, I can kind of say her whole family does.</p><p>"Christina used to have <a href=#>Bachelor</a> watch parties when we were together and, you know, it's not surprising to me at all."</p><p>He sarcastically added: "I kind of think during the divorce I might've even said, 'You just want to go on <a href=#>The Bachelor</a>.'"</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><h2>GROWING UP IN THE SPOTLIGHT</h2><p>Christina is the daughter of musician Ellen Irlene Mandrell and is the niece of famous country singer Barbara Mandrell. Her father, Rob Pincus, is well-known in the self-defense world as a professional trainer and is also an author and consultant.</p><p>Although she comes from a talented musical family, Christina, herself, does not have the same aspirations.</p><p>Blake said she "doesn't like to sing" so much despite being "an incredible singer."</p><p>"I think I might be the only person who's ever really heard her sing," her ex joked. "So, she's not trying to like follow in the families' legacy."</p><p>He further stated that she's more interested in acting.</p><p>"Acting is something that she's always loved to do, and, you know, several times she's done very small movies or music videos here in Nashville and things of that sort," he shared.</p><p>"But, I would love to see her get into singing because she's extremely talented... That's something I always used to push her to do."</p><h2>LIFE POST DIVORCE</h2><p>Although Blake is adamant that he and Christina "get along well" post-divorce, it didn't appear to have always been that way.</p><p>When the content creator <a href=#>filed for divorce</a>, she cited "irreconcilable differences" and "inappropriate marital conduct."</p><p>Blake denied any cheating and "did not know" what she was referring to, nor did he have any part in the divorce since he didn't file a response or show up to court.</p><p>Even though she was granted primary residential custody of their daughter, he told The U.S. Sun that it's more 50/50.</p><p>Now, he's moved on and is dating someone new.</p><p>And, the three of them, plus their daughter, have family outings.</p><p>Blake shared that he believes Christina is on The Bachelor "for all the right reasons" and thinks "she wants to do it for love."</p><h2>MORE THAN A COUNTRY GIRL</h2><p>Bachelor Nation watched as the <a href=#>Nashville</a> actress was introduced during the ATFR, along with four other contestants.</p><p>The <a href=#>other women</a> were introduced during Monday night's <a href=#>premiere episode</a>.</p><p>Fans might recall Christina had initially offered Zach a Jack Daniel's shot and wore cowgirl boots.</p><p>Blake responded to her first impression, stating, "It was definitely herself... She's very natural with the camera and so, that was very much herself.</p><p>"And I would imagine on the show it's going to be a lot like that too... I think the Christina on the show is going to be the Christina that everybody gets."</p><p>He further stated that Christina's "a very open person," so viewers will most likely hear more about her divorce on camera.</p><p>"I mean, really, Christina's a pretty country girl who doesn't want to act very country, but she's a really good person and she comes from a great family, and I still get along very well with her family," Blake added.</p><p>Even though Blakely's father is supportive of Christina being on the show, he isn't a fan of her daughter one day signing up.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"I don't want my daughter dating that way," he clarified.</p><p>The Bachelor airs Mondays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/bachelor-star-christina-mandrells-ex-789936264-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/bad-breakup-bachelors-christina-mandrell-789209470.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/1910b-gabby-rachel-one-man-789207425.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvYWqGeXyRaJmam5iaubC%2BjJyfq6GjqbavrYymmKecopq5rXnEsWSfmZ5iwKm71majqK6VqHq0vM6to6KfmKl8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbachelor-christina-mandrell-ex-fan-show-loves-spotlight.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbachelor-christina-mandrell-ex-fan-show-loves-spotlight.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbachelor-christina-mandrell-ex-fan-show-loves-spotlight.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbachelor-christina-mandrell-ex-fan-show-loves-spotlight.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbachelor-christina-mandrell-ex-fan-show-loves-spotlight.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbachelor-christina-mandrell-ex-fan-show-loves-spotlight.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./gofundme-campaign-raises-5-million-for-border-wall.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./gofundme-campaign-raises-5-million-for-border-wall.html>GoFundMe Campaign for Border Wall May Need to Be Refunded</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./miss-rfabulouss-boyfriend-list.html>Miss RFabulouss Boyfriend: Who is Miss RFabulous Dating?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./miss-rfabulouss-boyfriend-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
