Moreover, Cam is playing as safety for Oregon State Beavers.&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from that, Stoudamire has three stepsisters. However, Damon has decided to keep their identity a secret.

Consequently, he won the Pac-10 Player of the Year in 1995.</p><p>Also, check out:&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&lt;&lt;Ekpe Udoh Bio: Salary, Career, Stats, Contract, Beijing Ducks, Age Wiki >></a></strong></p><h2>How old is Damon Stoudamire?

Back in the day, he used to play as a point guard.
