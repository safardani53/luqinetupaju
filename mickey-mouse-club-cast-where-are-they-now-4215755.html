Just a few years after The Mickey Mouse Club was canceled, Britney became the opening act for <strong>NSYNC</strong>, which featured two Mickey Mouse Club alums: Justin Timberlake and <strong>JC Chasez</strong>. Her debut album, …Baby One More Time, became an instant hit in 1999. Her second album, Oops!… I Did It Again, was an even bigger sensation. She made her feature film debut in the 2002 film Crossroads. Britney continued to release new music over the years. She dated Timberlake from 1999 to 2002. She married <strong>Jason Alexander</strong> in 2004, but the marriage was annulled after 55 hours. A few months later, she got engaged to backup dancer <strong>Kevin Federline</strong>. They married two months later and had two sons, Sean and Jayden. Britney faced personal struggles, including her divorce from Kevin in 2006. She notoriously shaved her head in 2007 and was placed under a 5150 involuntary psychiatric hold in 2008. Following her breakdown, Britney entered into conservatorship with her father, <strong>Jamie Spears</strong>, which means he has control over her&nbsp;financial and medical affairs.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Despite her troubles, Britney kept on releasing albums. She became a judge for the second season of the U.S. version of The X-Factor. She began her Las Vegas residency in 2013 with&nbsp;Britney: Piece of Me. She was set to return for a second Las Vegas residency in 2019 but went on an “indefinite work hiatus.” She checked into a wellness center in April 2019. As of Aug. 2020, Britney seeks to alter <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the conservatorship</a> she has with her father to “reflect the major changes in her current lifestyle and her stated wishes,” according to documents filed by her lawyer. She also revealed her “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>desire not to perform at this time</a>.” A judge ruled to continue Britney’s conservatorship for another six months until Feb. 2021.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong><strong>Justin Timberlake</strong></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mickey-mouse-club-justin-timberlake-everett-collection-ap.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>Justin Timberlake</strong>, now 39,&nbsp;was a Mouseketeer on The Mickey Mouse Club reboot in 1993 and 1994. After the show came to an end, Justin joined the boy band NSYNC, which went on to become one of the most famous boy bands of all-time. Their biggest hits include “Bye Bye Bye,” “This I Promise You,” and “It’s Gonna Be Me.” NSYNC went on tours and performed at the Super Bowl, Oscars, and the Olympics. Justin dated Britney throughout this time, but they broke up in 2002. Justin went solo with is debut album Justified in 2002. His hit single “Cry Me A River” was inspired by his breakup with Britney. Justin performed at the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Janet Jackson</strong></a>, 54. In what was supposed to be a costume reveal, Justin accidentally ripped Janet’s top and her breast was exposed.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Justin focused on his solo music, but he also embraced an acting career as well. He starred in the 2010 critcially-acclaimed film The Social Network. He followed that with roles in Bad Teacher and Friends With Benefits. He voiced the lead role in the 2016 film Trolls. Justin released his fifth studio album, Man of the Trees, two days before he headlined the 2018 Super Bowl halftime show. In 2020, he returned for the Trolls sequel, Trolls World Tour.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>After Britney, Justin dated actress<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Cameron Diaz</strong></a>, 48, from 2003 to 2006.

She was selected to sing the theme song for Disney’s new movie Mulan in 1998. The song became a huge success.
