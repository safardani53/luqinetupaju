This isn’t what I want to do but it just isn’t fair on him or the kids right now."</p><p>Another offered her pocket bully on the same site for between £1,000 and £1,500, telling how it had a fight with her other dog.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>And a seller in <a href=#>Gateshead</a>, <a href=#>Tyne and Wear</a>, offered up a 15-month-old American XL bully for £850, admitting it "can be vicious towards other dogs".</p><p>They added that the dog had attacked their sons aged 10 and any buyer would "need to be able to handle him as he is strong".</p><p>An American XL bully advertised for £500 by a seller in County Down, <a href=#>Northern Ireland</a>, had the warning: "She may be a gentle giant but she is very strong."</p><p>And the owner of a male American XL bully in Redditch, <a href=#>Worcestershire</a>, wrote: "Only reason I'm getting rid of him is because my daughter is scared of his size - he's too big and it's intimidating her, causing her anixety."</p><p><a href=#>Animal</a> behaviourist Zoe Willingham accused "unscrupulous" breeders of breeding the animals to be "aggressive" guard dogs.</p><p>She added: "Then they are falling into family homes as pets, which is how you end up with this situation of people trying to sell them on because they can’t control them."</p><p>Gumtree's head of trust and safety Joseph Rindsland told The Sun Online: "At Gumtree, nothing is more important to us than the safety of our users and the welfare of the animals listed on our site.</p><p>"We will always follow government advice and legislation.</p><p>"Should the Home Office move forward with a ban, our dedicated safety team would make sure that it was reflected in our posting policies.</p><p>"In the meantime, we would ask that all our users seriously consider the characteristics of a dog and their needs before agreeing to rehome a pet.</p><p>"We have comprehensive educational material about different breeds on our site, which we would strongly recommend users read carefully."</p><p>Dogs like that should be banned</p><span class=quote-credit>Attack victim Ana Paun, 11</span><p>Freeads also said they would "update our policies" if the law and government recommendations on American XL bullies changed.</p><p>They also said the firm "takes our commitment to the safe rehoming of pets seriously" and works with "responsible and vetted" breeders.</p><p>They said: "The well-being of the pets featured on Freeads, as well as the safety of our community, holds paramount importance.</p><p>"Breed owners play an integral role in this process.</p><p>"We firmly believe in their responsibility to ensure the health and welfare of their pets.</p><p>"We strongly advise our members to diligently research and evaluate their compatibility with a pet before making the commitment to rehome.</p><p>"This is a crucial element to ensure a harmonious match between the pet's needs and the prospective owner's lifestyle."</p><p>The Sun Online has contacted Pets4Homes for further comment.</p><p>Brave Ana told yesterday how she feared she was going to die after being savaged by an XL bully dog in Bordesley Green, Birmingham.</p><p>Video footage showed the attack by the&nbsp;<a href=#>American XL bully</a>&nbsp;that left her badly wounded and two men who tried to intervene in hospital.</p><p><a href=#>Ms Braverman</a>&nbsp;shared the clip on <a href=#>X/Twitter</a> on Sunday and announced&nbsp;<a href=#>plans to ban</a>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href=#>American XL bully</a>&nbsp;breed.</p><p>And Ana, talking with her mum Monika’s permission, told The Sun Online: "<a href=#>Dogs</a>&nbsp;like that should be banned.</p><p>"The owner should be in&nbsp;<a href=#>prison</a>&nbsp;because he never did anything, he just let the dog bite everyone."</p><p>American XL bullys have been linked to nine deaths - including three children - since 2021.</p><p>The Home Secretary called XL bully dogs "a clear and lethal danger to our communities, particularly to children".</p><p>Her proposals have been backed by&nbsp;<a href=#>Labour</a>&nbsp;leader&nbsp;<a href=#>Sir Keir Starmer</a>, who used to be head of the&nbsp;<a href=#>Crown Prosecution Service</a>.</p><p><a href=#>XL Bullys</a>&nbsp;are bred from a blend of dogs, mainly the&nbsp;<a href=#>American</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>pit bull terrier</a>&nbsp;which was outlawed in&nbsp;<a href=#>Britain</a>&nbsp;in 1991.</p><p>Campaign group Bully Watch UK has recorded 351 attacks by the breed in 2023 alone.</p><p>They say 43 per cent of all maulings by dogs come from large bullys, even though the breed comprises a tiny proportion of all UK dogs.</p><p>There were 22,000&nbsp;<a href=#>dog attacks</a>&nbsp;causing injury in England and Wales last year, up by a third since the 16,000 in 2018.</p><h2>'WORK ON THE BACKYARD BREEDERS'</h2><p><a href=#>Jack Lis</a>, ten,&nbsp;was killed by an eight-stone American bully called Beast in November 2021 in Caerphilly, south&nbsp;<a href=#>Wales</a>.</p><p>Beast's owner Brandon Hayden, then 19, was jailed for four years in June last year and Amy Salter, then 29, for three years after they admitted being in charge of the out-of-control dog.</p><p>Jack's mother Emma Whitfield has now asked why the government did not act sooner to ban the breed.</p><p>She tweeted: "Where were you when my son was killed? Where were you when other innocent people were killed?</p><p>"If you're going to do something, please do it.</p><p>"Maybe you can do this and work on the backyard breeders and the thuggish owners ruining lives too."</p><p>Jonathan Hogg, a 37-year-old dad, was&nbsp;<a href=#>mauled to death</a>&nbsp;in May by an American bully XL in Leigh, Greater&nbsp;<a href=#>Manchester</a>.</p><p><a href=#>Natasha Johnson, 28</a>, was killed by dogs that same month while walking a pack -
