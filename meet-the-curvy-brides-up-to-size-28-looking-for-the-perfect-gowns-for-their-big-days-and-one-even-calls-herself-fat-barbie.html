Someone we knew split up and we jokingly asked if we could 'buy' their wedding.</p><p>"We weren't serious - it was way too much to plan. But they said yes so it happened. We bought their wedding."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000423792283.jpg><p>It was good news for Louisa as she got to marry in the location of her dreams, a hotel, whereas Duncan was initially more keen on more unusual locations – “like aircraft hangers,” &nbsp;she said.</p><p>NHS receptionist Louisa and carer Duncan actually met when they were teenagers - and she worked in the local supermarket.</p><p>"We had known each other for ages... but I think Duncan thought I was a bit out of his league," she said of their teenage encounter.</p><p>Explaining the origins of her nickname, she added: "I like being tanned, I like having my nails done and my hair."</p><p>The couple then reunited in September 2014 after reconnecting on Plenty of Fish.</p><p>Now parents to an amazing 11 children - including three they have had together, Hugo, Ezra, and Rafferty - they got engaged in March this year.</p><p>And in July, just a few months later, they married.</p><p>Louisa admitted: "Our first date was ridiculous... he came round for a cup of tea and a biscuit - but I wasn't sure he was that keen on me."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000423792453.jpg><p>After having the children they briefly separated but got back together.</p><p>She said, despite buying another couple's wedding, the day went swimmingly. "We paid £2,000 and it should have cost £5,500," she explained. "I organised it in eight weeks and we got all the food."</p><p>Best of all she had her perfect dress - in size 28.</p><p>With 44L breasts, she has faced bullying. "I've got people saying, 'You would be really pretty if you weren't so big," she explained.</p><p>"The first dress I put on was horrible but the second dress I felt like a princess... it pulled me in.</p><p>"I felt so confident and lovely. It was white and lace on it. It was sleeveless.</p><p>"I think my husband was blown away."</p><p>Asked about her sex life, she said: "We've got no problems in that department..."<br></p><h2><strong>Kia Cottrell, 30, Reading, Berkshire, is marrying Ryan Payne in March 2019</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000423792311.jpg><p>Size 22 American Kia moved to the UK from the USA four years ago – and didn’t expect to fall in love.</p><p>But after meeting Ryan, 40, the New Yorker cancelled ALL her other dates – and the pair have been inseparable ever since.</p><p>They’re getting married in March 2019 – and she has compared their wedding to that of another US-UK couple… Harry and Meghan.</p><p>“I want my wedding to be like Meghan and Harry’s… I’m American and he is British,” she said. “They have competition!”</p><p>She even joked their wedding would be similar – they are planning to hire a violinist and will marry in Horsley Towers in Surrey.</p><p>“It’s a castle,” she explained. “We want it to be really romantic.”</p><p>Explaining their meeting, she said: “I’d been dating nonchalantly to focus on my career and decided to join an online dating website.</p><p>“The first week on there I lined up three dates. Ryan was date number three… I cancelled all my other dates.”</p><p>A size 22, she has lost weight – but said Ryan loved her whatever.</p><p>“I’ve never been bullied or insulted,” she said. “The dress journey was nerve-wracking though because I have never tried one on.</p><p>“But I can’t wait for Ryan to see it.”<br></p><h2><strong>Zoe Dunklin, 45, from Northampton, is renewing vows to Andy in September this year</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Zoe-36034_ep213_002.jpg><p>Zoe, who is a double amputee and has a spinal injury and also a congenial disability, will renew her vows in September to husband Andy, 48,</p><p>The couple, who met at a cricket club dance and dinner and married 16 months later, will re-tie the knot on their 19th wedding anniversary.</p><p>But in the past some people have thought, as a result of her disability, Zoe wasn’t ALLOWED to marry.</p><p>“I’ve been asked, ‘Can disabled people get married?’” she explained. “I told them, ‘Yes and we have really good sex as well!’”</p><p>Zoe, who weighs 16-and-a-half stone and is a size 20/22, is a classic comfort eater.</p><p>“I’ve always been a big girl,” she said. “I attend a weight loss group every week,” she said.</p><p>“There are thousands of people out there like me. At the meetings every Monday we all say the same things: ‘We comfort eat’.</p><p>“When things are a bit stressful I hit the chocolates and the biscuits.”</p><p>The&nbsp;Paralympian explained how, through hard times, Andy had shown how much he loved her. &nbsp;“We're renewing on our 19th wedding anniversary… because it was on a Saturday,” she laughed.</p><p>“But, more seriously, it seemed like the right thing and right time to do it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000423792321.jpg><p>She continued: “My health has deteriorated over the past couple of years and Andy gave up work to be my carer.</p><p>“He’s really supported me. He’s come to every appointment and stood by me. There are not many men who would do that.</p><p>“It’s been difficult and Andy has been wonderful.</p><p>“Our family and friends have been great too and we want to thank them.”</p><p>Zoe, who played wheelchair basketball from the ages of 16 to 24, wasn’t concerned about getting a dress for her renewal because she knew she could order one online. “But I knew it would result in a bog-standard maxi,” she said. “I wanted something grand.”</p><p>So she turned to the ladies at TLC.</p><p>And she was delighted with what they presented her with.</p><p>“We’re marrying on September this year at our local registry office. I’ll be in an oyster-coloured dress and it is really special.</p><p>“They’d thought about my disability and what dresses will look good sitting down. I don’t want to be drowned in a heavy dress that’s like a duvet,” she said. “I can’t wait.”</p><p>Kia, Louisa and Zoe are just a few of the brides on TLC show Curvy Brides' Boutique where women prepare for the big day - with the help of dress experts&nbsp;Jo and Al.</p><ul><li><strong>Curvy Brides’ Boutique airs Fridays at 8pm on TLC</strong></li></ul><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN REAL LIFE</h2></p><p>Want more wedding news?
