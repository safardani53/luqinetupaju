Shaughna is likely to have stayed in hospital for three days, and will be required to rest up for a week or so.</p><p>"Within a few weeks or months, the swelling will go down and normal limb volume will resume."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/725b6cd2-5944-45ab-af4b-202203f4de6b.jpg><h2>What is lipoedema?</h2><p>According to the NHS lipoedema is a long term chronic condition that usually only affects women.</p><p>In rare cases it can also affect men and is a condition where there is an abnormal build up of fat cells.</p><p>This could be in areas of the body such as the legs, thighs and buttocks and occasionally the arms.</p><h2>What are the symptoms?&nbsp;</h2><p>The symptoms of lipoedema can vary from person to person but most people will experience what looks like swelling on their arms, legs and bum.</p><h2>1. Bracelet or band-like appearance</h2><p>Lipoedema creates swelling and one of the key symptoms on the areas where you have the condition is the bracelet effect.</p><p>With the condition both legs and arms are usually enlarged to the same extent.</p><p>It could look as though you have put a band, or hair tie around the area or as though you have a bracelet on too tight.</p><p>The affect will likely appear above the ankles and wrists.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000610325569.jpg><h2>2. Bruising easily</h2><p>We are all guilty of bumping into things unintentionally. But if you've bumped into a sharp edge and have a large bruise then you could have lipoedema.</p><p>The fat can sometimes be painful and feel heavy and hurt when banged, even if just gently.</p><p>Many women with the condition experience multiple and frequent bruising.</p><h2>3. Small broken veins under the skin</h2><p>Having small or broken veins under the skin usually looks like a little spider's web in the affected area.</p><p>Varicose veins are a common problem for people who are suffering with lipoedema.</p><p>If you're struggling with this then compression socks or tights could help.</p><h2>4. Feeling soft, doughy or cold</h2><p>If your skin is cold to the touch then you might have lipoedema.</p><p>Your skin might feel "doughy" as quite often with the condition fluid builds up in the tissue making the skin feel squishy.</p><h2>5. Aches or pains</h2><p>If you're experiencing aches or pains and you haven't been hitting the gym hard then this might be a sign of lipoedema.</p><p>You need to remember that if you have this condition your body is usually carrying and storing extra fat cells around your joints.</p><p>This can weigh heavy on the body and can often cause you to experience an aching sensation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000609732200-1.jpg><h2>Why did Shaughna Phillips have surgery?</h2><p>Shaughna said she wanted to have surgery as it was part of her body that she was "insecure about".</p><p>Posting to Instagram earlier this week she <a href=#>revealed that she had been diagnosed with the condition</a> after coming out of the Love Island villa.</p><p>She said: "I've kind of always had an insecurity about my legs, but there were so many questions about if I'd ever been diagnosed with lipoedema, and I didn't even know what it was."</p><p>She added: "So after some research and going to the doctors, I was finally diagnosed and then had my surgery on Wednesday.</p><p>"I'm recovering, I'm doing really well. I've got make-up on today, I've brushed my hair today and, yeah, I'm just really looking forward to kind of the process of it.</p><p>"It's not an overnight thing, I have to keep up with my compression garments and things like that, but so far so good."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">HEALTH LATEST</h2></p><p>The reality star, who appeared on the winter 2020 series of Love Island, shared a picture of herself lying in a hospital bed, saying: "Surgery swag. I'm so high BTW."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>In another photo, both of her legs were seen in plaster casts while her feet were left swollen and poking out of the bottom.</p><p>Posting this shot on her Instagram stories,&nbsp;<a href=#>Shaughna</a>&nbsp;wrote: "Hello swollen tootsies."</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Love Island's Shaughna Phillips reveals she's had liposuction on her legs after being diagnosed with lipoderma</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5Brbm1xYmiEcLjIqaaenJWirm6BjKywpqikpLq0ecuorZ5lmai5orrDZqqhmaWcta%2BtjKmfoqScnr20ecOimKCmn6i2tHs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flipoedema-5-symptoms-love-island-shaughna-phillips-diagnosis.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flipoedema-5-symptoms-love-island-shaughna-phillips-diagnosis.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flipoedema-5-symptoms-love-island-shaughna-phillips-diagnosis.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flipoedema-5-symptoms-love-island-shaughna-phillips-diagnosis.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flipoedema-5-symptoms-love-island-shaughna-phillips-diagnosis.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flipoedema-5-symptoms-love-island-shaughna-phillips-diagnosis.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./and-just-like-that-miranda-son-brady-interview.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./and-just-like-that-miranda-son-brady-interview.html>Whats Next For Mirandas Son Brady Interview Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./robin-williams-wife-attends-night-at-museum-premiere-costars-reflect-20141212.html>Robin Williams' Wife Attends Night at Museum Premiere, Costars Reflect</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./robin-williams-wife-attends-night-at-museum-premiere-costars-reflect-20141212.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
