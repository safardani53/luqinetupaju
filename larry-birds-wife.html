He is considered one of the greatest basketball players of all time.</strong></p><p>Larry, nicknamed the “Hick From French Lick” and “Larry Legend,” is the only person in NBA history to have been named Rookie of the Year, Most Valuable Player, Finals MVP, All-Star MVP, Coach of the Year, and Executive of the Year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Dinah-Mattingly-With-Her-Husband-Larry-Bird.jpg><p>Larry’s personal life is generally not in the limelight. For example, his wife and kids are rarely seen in the media.</p><p>As of 2023, the NBA legend is married to Dinah Mattingly. However, he has been married once before as well; his first marriage lasted for a short time.</p><p>In this article, let’s learn about this greatest former player’s wife’s life in detail. Before we go on with all the details, let’s check out interesting quick facts about Dinah:</p><h2>Quick Facts</h2><table class=mytable width=795><tbody readability=4><tr><td><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td>Dinah Mattingly</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Common Name</strong></td><td>Dinah Mattingly</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nick Name</strong></td><td>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birthdate</strong></td><td>November 16, 1954</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>69 Years Old</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Zodiac Sign</strong></td><td>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mother’s Name</strong></td><td>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Father’s Name</strong></td><td>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Siblings</strong></td><td>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birthplace</strong></td><td>Vigo County, Indiana</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Home Town</strong></td><td>Vigo County, Indiana</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Citizenship</strong></td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td><strong>Residence</strong></td><td>West Baden Springs, Indiana</td></tr><tr><td><strong>College</strong></td><td>Indiana State University</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Education</strong></td><td>Marketing Major</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Height</strong></td><td>5 ft 5 in / 167 cm / 1.67 m</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>56 kg / 123 lb</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Eye Color</strong></td><td>Hazel</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hair Color</strong></td><td>Golden</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Shoe Size</strong></td><td>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Martial Status</strong></td><td>Married</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Husband</strong></td><td>Larry Bird</td></tr><tr readability=3><td><strong>Children</strong></td><td>Conner Bird, Mariah Bird&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Famous For</strong></td><td>Larry Bird’s Wife</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hobbies</strong></td><td>Travel, Reading</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td><strong>$1 Million</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Affiliated Brands</strong></td><td>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Social Media</strong></td><td>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Website</strong></td><td>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Last-Update</strong></td><td>December 2023</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Early Life & Family</h2><p>Dinah was born on November 16, 1954, in Vigo County, Indiana, to her parents, whose information is missing at the moment.</p><p>There is no information about her personal life before she gained fame.</p><p>However, she grew up in a loving and supportive family. Unfortunately, we do not have any information about her high school.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/larry.bird_.celtics.jpg><p>It is said that Dinah was a sports enthusiast during her college days.</p><p>Even though she was also involved in sports, she has not shared which sport it was it was or the level of success she achieved.</p><p>Similar to Larry, she also attended Indiana State University. But they did not date each other at the time.</p><p>It is presumed that Larry and Dinah must have gotten closer to each other after Larry’s failed relationship with Janet.</p><p>Dinah is two years older than Larry, which might also be another reason they did not hit it off immediately.</p><h3>Wedding</h3><p>Larry and Dinah wed in 1989, marking Larry’s second marriage.</p><p>There is very little information about Dinah on the internet as she likes to keep it private. She came into the limelight after getting hitched to the NBA legend.</p><p>The wedding occurred in a friend’s home in Terre Haute, Indiana. Besides the bride and groom, just five of the closest friends and family witnessed the marriage.</p><p>It is also said that the couple wore stonewashed jeans to the ceremony.</p><h2>Media Focused On Their Age Difference</h2><p>The media focused on their two-year age difference during their wedding, but the couple seemed unbothered.</p><p>Dinah is a beautiful woman with golden locks that she likes to style in a bob cut.</p><p>Compared to Larry, she might seem like a short woman, but her height is average, around 1.67 meters.</p><p>Dinah and Larry have been married for almost four decades. Primarily, she has supported him abundantly during his transition from NBA to coaching.</p><p>While most players find it hard to transition from playing to coaching, Larry pulled it through very exquisitely.</p><p>But, of course, most of it happened because of undying support from Dinah.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though they don’t show off their love and support, their bond is strong. Their married life has stood the test of time.</p><p>Larry has meddled in many controversies over the years. Many media outlets have accused him of cheating on his wife. But Dinah has stuck with him throughout the difficult times.&nbsp;</p><p>Around 2014, the media started rumors about Larry cheating on her with a young woman.</p><p>The news portals were full of a mystery woman putting her hand on Larry’s leg, whom everyone believed to be his mistress.</p><p>However, he revealed that the mystery woman was his daughter, and the infidelity rumors were untrue.</p><h2>Children</h2><p>Larry and Dinah do not have any biological children. However, they have adopted two kids, Conner and Mariah.</p><p>They adopted Mariah in 1991 and Conner in 1992. The exact reason why they went for adoption is not known.</p><p>Also, the age of the children is unknown, but both are in their 20s. They are independent and pursue their interests.&nbsp;</p><p>Their daughter Mariah Bird graduated from Indiana University, studying Tourism, Hospitality, and Event Management.</p><p>After graduation, she interned with PS&E. Later, she officially joined their team as an event coordinator.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dinah-mattingly.jpg><p>Besides being an excellent event manager, Mariah has also obtained a real estate license. Therefore, we can say that she is very hardworking and talented.</p><p>Nonetheless, their son Conner has made headlines for primarily<a href=# rel=noopener> negative reasons</a>. As a child, fans used to spot him with his parents at Larry’s games.</p><p>It was reason enough to believe he might follow in his father’s footsteps to be an athlete.</p><p>Unfortunately, in 2011 he was arrested for underage drinking and misconduct and imprisoned in 2013 after being charged with attempted murder and possession of marijuana.</p><p>The charges stemmed from some altercations with his ex-girlfriend. Reportedly, Conner was 22 when he drove his car at her.</p><p>He pleaded guilty to some charges, which shortened his sentence, while some charges were dropped.&nbsp;</p><p>Larry and Dinah have refused to make any comments on the matter.&nbsp;</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>Dinah has collected a net worth of around $1 million as of 2023 from her different ventures.</p><p>However, her collective net worth with her husband is higher than that.</p><p>As of 2023, Larry Bird has a net worth of $75 million.</p><p>This wealth makes him one of the wealthiest people in the NBA. The couple owns multiple houses and lives a luxurious life of their own.</p><h2>Larry Bird’s First Wife, Janet Condra</h2><p>In 1975, Larry married Janet Condra, the lucky lady who was his high school sweetheart.</p><p>The couple first met at Spring Valley Highschool, where they shared classes. The classmates quickly became friends, and it eventually blossomed into romance.&nbsp;</p><p>But the romance did not last long following the marriage, and they divorced after a year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Larry-Bird-Wife-Janet-Condra.jpg><p>Though the exact reason for this marriage failure is unknown, we can guess that the differences were raised from Bird moving to Indiana.</p><p>Whatever the differences were, they were significant because the couple did not stay on good terms afterward.</p><p>The divorce was finalized on October 31, 1976. Surprisingly, they reconciled and lived together.</p><h3>Biological Daughter, Corrie&nbsp;</h3><p>The new union resulted in a child, a daughter named Corrie, born on August 4, 1977.&nbsp;</p><p>But this reunion also did not last long; consequently, the couple ended their relationship.</p><p>Initially, Larry denied that Corrie was his kid and rejected Janet’s request for child support.</p><p>The paternity test confirmed that he was the father. After that, he sent monthly checks for child support.</p><p>He set up an account from which Corrie could draw monthly support checks until she turned 18.</p><p>Janet later mentioned that she single-handedly raised Corrie because Larry was never interested in meeting his daughter.</p><p>His newfound success with the Celtics made him a busy person. Corrie, his biological daughter, asked for him, but he never had time to be with her.</p><h3>Larry, As A Father</h3><p>The mother-daughter duo tried their best to stay in touch with their father. Corrie used to write him letters, and Janet included school pictures and her report cards.</p><p>They tried to send the letters via certified mail to ensure that Larry received them, but to no avail. They still did not hear back from him.</p><p>Janet appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show in 1998, revealing more about the father-daughter relationship.</p><p>She shared with Oprah that she was always excused from Corrie for not having her father around.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/corrie-ft.jpg><p>Similarly, Janet also acknowledged how hurt Corrie felt by his actions. “I couldn’t protect her from the hurt caused by her dad.”</p><p>“I could protect her from everything else, but not that,” she expressed.</p><p>Janet continued to be an exceptional mother to her child and raised her in the best way possible.</p><p>Corrie met Larry later when her step-mom (Dinah) invited her to a Pacers game.</p><h3>Oprah Winfrey Show</h3><p>In the same show with Oprah, Corrie also appeared alongside her mother. Oprah asked her why she couldn’t move on from her father even after 20 years.</p><p>Corrie replied that she had moved on in some ways. She said, “But I still have hope that he can be a part of my life.”&nbsp;</p><p>She got some athletic skills from her father and played basketball during high school. Then, she went to Indiana University and continued playing basketball there too.</p><p>Corrie was terrific at it. However, she did not continue it professionally. Corrie married in May 2008, raising her own family and working as a clinic manager.&nbsp;</p><h2>About Larry Bird</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Larry Bird</a> is a former NBA player born in West Baden, Indiana, on December 7, 1956, to Georgia (nee Kerns) and Claude Joseph “Joe Birds.”</p><p>His father was a veteran of the Korean War. His parents were of Irish, Scottish, and some Native American descent.</p><p>The former basketball player divorced mom single-handedly raised Larry, his three brothers, and a sister. Soon after the divorce, his dad committed suicide.&nbsp;</p><p>Larry played basketball to escape his family troubles and soon got good at it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Larry-Bird-in-College.jpg><p>He had an outstanding collegiate career and was a strong prospect for the NBA draft.</p><p>Boston Celtics drafted him in 1978 as a sixth overall pick in round 1. During that time, he was the highest-paid rookie in sports history.&nbsp;</p><p>Larry had an extraordinary career overall, with three NBA titles and 3 NBA MVPs.</p><p>Larry said, “The corner shot and the one out the top…that really at the top of the key, they’re the shots I like to take.” In an interview which was taken in 2020 by Boston Celtics legend Kevin McHale.</p><p>Lary didn’t even practice three-point shooting, but the irony is he is one of the greatest three-point shooters of all time.&nbsp;</p><p>He retired in 1992; however, the Celtics kept him as a special assistant in the front office till 1997. Larry then moved to Indiana Pacers as a coach.</p><p>Despite no prior coaching experience, he gave the best results and received the ” NBA Coach of the Year ” award. However, he gave up coaching in 2000.</p><h3>Recent Venture</h3><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Magic Johnson</a> and Larry Bird hated each other before shooting an advertisement, according to a March 2, 2023 report.</p><p>They became a good friend in a 1987 commercial shoot for Converse in French Lick, Indiana.</p><p>According to Basketball Network, on March 11, 2023, Bird was the Celtics icon who knew he wasn’t the most athletic player. It did not prevent him from finding a way to dominate the game.</p><p>On March 22, <a href=# rel=noopener>Jayson Tatum</a> made the same record as Larry in scoring, which was set 35 years ago. Bird’s franchise record was 39 for most 30-point games in a single season.</p><h2>Popularity Graph</h2><p>Dinah Mattingly is the famous wife of Larry Bird, a former professional basketball player, coach, president, and advisor in the NBA.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Dinah-Mattingly.jpg><p>The above graph demonstrates that she has not fallen out of the trend.
