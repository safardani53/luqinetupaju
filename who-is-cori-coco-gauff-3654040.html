She enters the tournament ranked No. 4 in the world. Her last title win was the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>WTA ASB Classic</a> at the start of the year, and she looks to make a splash on the grass in England.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“If she can get that forehand going, like <strong>Iga</strong> [<strong>Świątek</strong>, the No. 1-ranked player], very similar grips, but Iga shortens her swings and accelerates better,” tennis legend <strong>Chris Evert </strong>told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Root</a>. “If she can get her forehand to be a little bit more like Iga’s, I think she’ll have the complete game. She’s going to win a Grand Slam. I mean, she’s so young still, it’s going to happen for her eventually. Who knows, it could happen this Wimbledon.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>With that said, here’s a look at Coco.</p><h2>Coco Grauff Is A Tennis Player.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/coco-gauff-will-miss-tokyo-olympics-for-testing-positive-shutterstock-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Born on March 13, 2004, Cori “Coco” Grauff grew up in Atlanta. She became interested in Tennis at age four after watching <strong>Serena Williams </strong>win the Australian Open in 2009. She began playing at age six, and at age seven, her family moved to Delray Beach, Florida, where she could have better training opportunities. Coco credits winning the “Little Mo” eight-and-under nationals as when she knew she wanted to be a tennis player when she grew up. “I loved tennis,” she said in 2020, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Guardian</a>. “I was so-so about it in the beginning because when I was younger, I didn’t want to practice at all. I just wanted to play with my friends. When I turned eight, that was when I played ‘Little Mo’ and after that, I decided to do that for the rest of my life.”</p><h2>She Is Following In Serena Williams’ Footsteps.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/coco-gauff-will-miss-tokyo-olympics-for-testing-positive-shutterstock-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>In 2017, Coco listed her favorite players in the following order: “Serena, <strong>Venus </strong>[<strong>Williams</strong>], <strong>Madison Keys</strong>, and <strong>Sloan Stephens</strong>,” she said, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ESPN</a>. Coco met first met Serena at the “Little Mo” tournament in New York, and they met again in 2015 during the shooting of a Delta commercial in West Palm Beach. “It was fun, a great experience,” Cori said to ESPN. “She has always been my favorite player. I got to hit some serves to her. I also met her in Nice, France [at the <strong>Patrick Mouratoglou</strong> training facility].”4</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>At age ten, Coco began training at France’s Mouratoglou Academy, run by Serena’s longtime coach. The training seemed to pay off. In 2014, she won the USTA Clay Court National 12-under title. At the time, she was 10 years, 3 months old, the youngest champion in history.</p><h2>Coco Had A Breakout In 2019…</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Coco turned pro in 2018 and made her WTA debut at the Miami Open, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ESPN</a>. She won her first match before losing in the second round. Her big breakout came the following year. After losing in straight sets in the second round of qualifying at the French Open, Coco secured a spot in Wimbledon after her application for a wildcard entry was approved. She surged through qualifying and defeated Venus Williams before ultimately losing in the fourth round to eventual champion, <strong>Simona Halep</strong>. “I wouldn’t be here without you,” Coco told Venus following her Wimbledon victory. Venus had already had four grand slam wins under her belt before Coco was born in 2004.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Made for the big stage ✨<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@CocoGauff</a> becomes the youngest player since 1991 to win in the first round of the ladies' singles, beating Venus Williams 6-4, 6-4<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#Wimbledon</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/hfgcQGdZtq</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>— Wimbledon (@Wimbledon) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>July 1, 2019</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-12>The run resulted in Coco being ranked No. 141 in the world.

She won the 2019 Linz Open in Austria, defeating <strong>Jelena Ostapenko </strong>in the finale. She was 15 at the time. She won her second WTA tournament in May 2021, claiming the Emilia-Romagna Open after defeating <strong>Wang Qiang </strong>in two straight sets.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>In 2022, she made it all the way to the final of the French Open. She fell to <strong>Iga</strong> <strong>Świątek&nbsp;</strong>in two straight sets.</p><h2>She Uses Her Platform To Spread A Message.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>Coco has used her newfound fame and celebrity to speak out on social justice, particularly the countless number of Black men and women <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>killed by police in America</a>. “Wimbledon has given me an opportunity to raise money and raise awareness for other things and I’m glad that I was able to,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Guardian</a>. “With every match I win, I seem to get more and more people following me, so that’s good. And that means more and more awareness of subjects I care about. I always wanted to not just be a tennis player.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>“Lately, younger people are leading movements, and I guess the world has to get used to it because we’re used to older people telling us what to do,” she added. “My generation has just decided it was time to speak up on our own about things. I do follow the [climate] movement a lot, and I’m learning about ways we can better change, at least my lifestyle and the way my family lives.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2KwsL7IZpqom59itKLBxZ9kbG5laX11fI4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-cori-coco-gauff-3654040.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-cori-coco-gauff-3654040.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-cori-coco-gauff-3654040.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-cori-coco-gauff-3654040.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-cori-coco-gauff-3654040.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-cori-coco-gauff-3654040.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./stadium-bigger-than-wembley-left-abandoned-china.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./stadium-bigger-than-wembley-left-abandoned-china.html>Stadium bigger than Wembley with 100,000 seats left half-finished and surrounded by cranes after clu</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kiko-loureiro.html>Kiko Loureiro</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kiko-loureiro.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
