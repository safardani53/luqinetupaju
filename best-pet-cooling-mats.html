<time>19 Mar 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>WHEN the weather warms up, our four-legged friends may need a hand to stop them from overheating – and the best dog cooling mats provide just that.</p><p>Of course they’re not just for dogs, you may need a cat cooling mat to keep your feline happy and stress-free on hot days, and the great thing about pet cooling mats is they come in all shapes and sizes.</p><p>Yes, even if your fur baby is a rabbit, rat or hamster, you’ll find a cooling mat to suit them.</p><p>Not all cooling mats function in the same way. Some need to be refrigerated or charged up first and work their magic by cooling down your pet's skin and therefore dropping their body temperature.</p><p>Others are made from material that is designed to absorb heat and prevent your pet from overheating.</p><p>You can use cooling mats to protect your pet during stuffy car journeys, pop one in their bed or crate to help them sleep on <a href=# rel=noopener>hot nights</a>, or use them outdoors alongside a pet paddling pool to keep your pet comfortable and chilled during a heatwave.</p><p>There are designs to fit every situation and taste. Or why not make a style statement – fruit-design cooling mat anyone?</p><h2>Best pet cooling mats at a glance:</h2><h2>Lauva Pet Dog Cooling Mat</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Capture-123.jpg><ul><li class="products_shared_product-info_index__title products_shared_index__heading globals_fonts__levatoNormal" data-reactid=.w2ly6th9mk.1.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.1><strong>Lauva Pet Dog Cooling Mat</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>£19.99 from Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>This pet cooling mat works to cool both pets and their owners down.</p><p>Made with a pressure-activated, non-toxic gel, it delivers a continuous cooling feeling for your pet and absorbs their body heat so they don't overheat or get dehydrated.</p><p>The mat is said to keep your furry friends 7-9 degrees below ambient temperature - which is ideal after long, hot walks or park hangs.</p><p>The folding design packs away easily for storage or travel, and it recharges automatically every 20 minutes.</p><p>It has a bevvy of five-star reviews from customers who are impressed with its quality and how much their pets are enjoying it.</p><p><strong>How to use:</strong> Pressure activated, <strong>Dimensions: </strong>90 x 50 x 2cm,&nbsp;<strong>Best suited to: </strong>Dogs</p><h2>SnuggleSafe Coolpad</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Capture-125.jpg><ul><li><strong>Snuggle Safe Coolpad 30 x 25cm<span class=a-size-large>,</span>£10 from Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Got a small animal in your home that needs cooling down this summer?

This bed is ideal for that situation.</p><p>It has a foam base and polyester filling for support and comfort, but its cooling inner mat also provides cold relief. You don't need a fridge or freezer for this one because it's filled with non-toxic cooling gel and will stay at a chilly 5-10 degrees cooler than room temperature for most of the night.

Humans know to wear sunscreen and stay in the shade in extreme heat, but we can't always control how much UV exposure our pets get (especially cats with cat flaps who come and go as they please).</p><p>Pets can still be sunburnt and get heatstroke (which can be fatal), so it is important to protect them from the sun. While a regular cool mat will keep their body temperatures down, this one also has a detachable canopy that provides up to UV 50 protection.</p><p>That way, your dog or cat can enjoy the sounds of the birds and the cool breeze blowing through their fur, but they'll be doing so in a safe, shady spot.</p><p><strong>How to use:</strong> Pressure activated, <strong>Dimensions: </strong>105 x 76 x 90cm,&nbsp;<strong>Best suited to: </strong>Cats</p><h2>Are pet cooling mats safe?</h2><p>Pet cooling mats are typically filled with a non-toxic gel that's pressure-activated, so they're completely safe for pets to use.</p><p>That being said, you'll still want to supervise your pet to make sure they don't chew their mat; if they ingest anything, it could lead to tummy troubles.</p><p>There are also non-gel cooling mats made from breathable ice silk available for dogs and cats. These are more like thin blankets for your pet to lie on in the heat and there's nothing to spill out if they do burst – so if you own a 'chewer', this may be a good option for you.</p><h2>What is a pet cooling mat?</h2><p>A pet cooling mat is exactly what it sounds like, it's a mat or blanket that is designed to keep your pet cool when the weather is warm.</p><p>During the summer months, it can be particularly hard for our furry friends to cool off, and it is easy for them to overheat, which can be very dangerous for their health.</p><p>Cooling mats are a way to lower their body temperature, which is especially useful if your pet is a bit of a sun worshipper!</p><h2>How do pet cooling mats work?</h2><p>With gel mats, the gel inside is activated by pressure – so when your pup (or cat) sits on the mat it cools them down.</p><p>Once warmed, this gel then recharges and cools down again when the pressure (aka your pet) moves off it.</p><p>If you have a water-filled pet cooling mat, it's similar to a water bed in the way that the cool water absorbs heat from your pet's body.</p><h2>Are pet cooling mats any good?</h2><p>Pet cooling mats can be incredibly useful, as keeping our beloved furbabies cool can be a huge worry in summer, especially for those of us whose houses get particularly warm.</p><p>Using a pet cooling mat will reduce stress for owners of particular breeds, larger dogs, dogs with thicker coats and dogs with shorter snouts – all of whom can struggle in the heat.</p><h2>How much do cooling mats cost?</h2><p>The price of a pet cooling mat varies depending on the technology behind it and the size. Typically, they'll cost between £10 and £50.</p><p>On average, the cheapest option in our roundup is the <a href=#>Snuggle Safe Coolpad</a> from Amazon (£10), and the most expensive is the All For Paws Chill Out Fresh Breeze Cooling Dog Mat from Pets at Home (almost £50). You'll find that the mats get more expensive the bigger and the more bed-like they are. For example, the large version of the Scruffs Dog Cool Bed costs £70.</p><h2>Where to buy cat and dog cooling mats in the UK</h2><p>You can buy cooling mats for pets both on the high street and online, at pet stores, homeware retailers and supermarkets. Good places to visit online include:</p><h2>Do you put dog cooling mats in the fridge?</h2><p>Some dog cooling mats are designed to be chilled in the fridge before use, and it's the refrigeration that activates their cooling power. However, others do not need to be and should not be put in the fridge — especially if they have electric components. Check the instructions before using your cooling mat.</p><h2>Can humans use pet cooling mats?</h2><p>Humans can use pet cooling mats, as long as they don't have a weight limit. For example, if it's a canopy bed that can only take the weight of a pet, humans cannot lie on that. But, if it's a simple, flat gel cooling mat, humans can easily use these.</p><p>It's worth noting, though, that <a href=# rel=noopener>cooling mats for people</a> do exist. Amazon, homeware retailers and some supermarkets sell cooling gel mattress and pillow pads that work in the same way and they'll probably be more effective because they're the appropriate size for humans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZmppZ2eDdICRaJmeq6RivabAjJymqKSZo7RuucCtqmg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-pet-cooling-mats.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbest-pet-cooling-mats.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbest-pet-cooling-mats.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbest-pet-cooling-mats.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-pet-cooling-mats.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-pet-cooling-mats.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./angel-quezada.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./angel-quezada.html>Angel Quezada</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-cora-jakes-coleman-dating.html>Who is Cora Jakes Coleman Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-cora-jakes-coleman-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
