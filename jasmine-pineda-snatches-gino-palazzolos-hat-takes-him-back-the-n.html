They were her gifts — for their first meeting, and for Christmas.</p><p>Jasmine pitched her toothbrush into the dirt.&nbsp;</p><img

src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/jasmine-pineda-sugar-babies-1024x576.png><p>Though she moved out of their cabin and into her own, she did take the time to confront Gino on what she had learned.</p><p>Gino’s old messages to taunt his ex, before he met Jasmine, had involved bragging about how much he had paid his sugar babies.</p><p>While certainly there is nothing wrong with sex work, Jasmine had to wonder if she was in a real relationship, or if this was how he saw her.</p><img

him out, however.</p><p>She genuinely loved Gino, which is why this hurt so much.</p><p>He didn’t just betray her trust — he broke her heart.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/jasmine-pineda-feels-like-a-tool-used-to-make-his-ex-jealous-1024x576.png><p>Jasmine felt like a fool and like a tool.</p><p>She had been used like a pawn in Gino’s twisted campaign against his ex.</p><p>After consideration, she realized that she might be able to sue Gino for this unthinkable breach of privacy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/jasmine-pineda-you-did-bad-to-me-youll-pay-for-it-1024x576.png><p>After a day of processing the wrongs against her — and a lot of drinking — Jasmine returned to Gino’s cabin.</p><p>There, he had spent much of the day in a nearly catatonic state, processing the ruins of his romance.</p><p>However, when she returned, Gino clearly felt like fighting back … even though he was the only one who had done wrong in this context.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>For reasons that we cannot fully explain, Gino decided to play word games.</p><p>He challenged her description of her photos as "nudes," as her genitals were apparently not showing, only her breasts.</p><p>Jasmine’s response was simply to retaliate.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Jasmine lunged forward, but she wasn’t trying to hit Gino.</p><p>(We are glad of that — domestic violence is no joke, and it has no place in the "entertainment" world of reality television)</p><p>Instead, she grabbed Gino’s treasured hat from his head, exposing his scalp to the cameras and to the world.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>It is not, by any means, the equivalent of sharing her private nude photos.</p><p>We’re not saying that it was the right thing to do, either.</p><p>However, given the emotional intensity of the moment and Gino’s choice to haggle over the meaning of words and technicalities, one can understand.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/jasmine-pineda-screams-with-heartbreak-1024x576.png><p>As you can see in the video clip, Gino is bald, as we knew, but has some odd patches of short dark "denial hair" on the back of his head.</p><p>Perhaps the wildest moment came after Jasmine had taken the hat.</p><p>Gino apparently came prepared to lose his hat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/jasmine-pineda-lunges-again-1024x576.png><p>Gino calmly grabbed his backpack and opened it up.</p><p>From within it, he pulled another hat, which he placed on his head.</p><p>While this moment of levity was much needed for viewers, it showed that he was more focused upon his comfort than Jasmine’s heartbreak.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/jasmine-pineda-lunges-for-gino-palazzolo-producer-says-dont-1024x576.png><p>Viewers have seen Jasmine burst into tears over the most unreasonable, irrational topics.</p><p>She once cried and wailed over the paint on the walls at Gino’s house, which she has never even visited.</p><p>However, in this instance, her pain was extremely reasonable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>Jasmine briefly taunted Gino with the idea that she might retaliate by leaking his dick pics.</p><p>(This would also be a crime in many places and wholly unacceptable)</p><p>She did not, however, instead taunting him by saying that, unlike her breasts, his penis was not worth flaunting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/jasmine-pineda-goes-on-a-romantic-boat-tour-alone-1024x576.png><p>Jasmine once again lunged at Gino.</p><p>While it appears that she was again reaching for his hat (now his second hat), producers couldn’t chance it.</p><p>Considering the anger, sadness, and alcohol fueling the confrontation, they stepped in, separating the two of them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

cabin.</p><p>She spent the night crying.</p><p>However, you can see her second attempt to expose Gino’s scalp to the world in this video clip:&nbsp;</p><img

src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/jasmine-pineda-screams-with-heartbreak-1024x576.png><p>After a night of weeping, Jasmine felt that she had no more tears.</p><p>Her long term plans with Gino were now a painful memory.</p><p>In fact, even some short-term plans needed to change.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

two of them, where they would eat while being driven around on a boat.</p><p>Jasmine opted to take the cruise herself, noting that this was, after all, a last-minute gift to her.</p><p>On the boat, she spoke extensively to producers, clearly still processing what had happened, but now feeling much calmer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/jasmine-pineda-he-love-me-i-know-that-1024x576.png><p>Thing took an odd turn after Jasmine returned to Gino’s cabin to retrieve her purse.</p><p>She and Gino spoke briefly … and he asked if they could speak more.</p><p>Jasmine agreed, saying that it would be good if they could walk together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Gino pleaded with Jasmine to give him another chance, vowing to never do anything like this again.</p><p>However, Jasmine asked a very reasonable question: why in the world should she?</p><p>No answer in the world could have justified a reconciliation … but that is what happened anyway.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The two of them shared the world’s most awkward hug.</p><p>(Yes, we are even counting <a href=#>Ben’s hugs with Mahogany</a>)</p><p>Speaking to the camera, Jasmine tried to explain.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>She knew exactly how viewers would react to her.</p><p>Gino had betrayed her.</p><p>That should be a total dealbreaker for anyone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>A tearful Jasmine explained that, because Gino loves her, she feels that it’s worth another shot.</p><p>It’s her life, and it’s her mistake to make.</p><p>But it is, without a doubt, a mistake.</p><ul
