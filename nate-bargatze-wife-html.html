<time>14 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>"Dubbed by<a href=# rel="follow noopener"> Atlantic</a> as the "The Nicest Man in Stand-Up," Nate Bargatze often derives material for his comedy from his everyday life experiences, including his interactions with his family, friends,&nbsp;wife, and his daughter. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In 2023, his famous stand-up special Hello World was released on<a href=# rel="follow noopener"> Amazon Prime and it became the platform's biggest comedy special debut.</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Over the years, Bargatze has shared many stories regarding his family on his shows,&nbsp;including about his cheap wedding, his dependency on his wife, how he met his wife, how they felt seeing her ex-boyfriend, and her silent treatments.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>&nbsp;But his&nbsp;piercing sarcasm has brought laughter more than offended eyes because of his <a href=# rel="follow noopener">family-friendly</a> slow, build-up style of inoffensive humor. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>In this article, we exclusively cover about&nbsp;the&nbsp;Nashville native's age, wife, daughter, tours, stand-up special Hello World, and his net worth.&nbsp;</p><h2>Nate Bargatze met his Wife At Applebees</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Bargatze and his wife Laura Bargatze met for the first time at Applebee’s on Thompson Lane. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Both of them were in their early 20s at the time: she worked as a server and he worked as a host.</p><p>They were just friends initially, but The Little Mermaid's soundtrack brought the two together.</p><p>Laura <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared the story</a> in an episode of the&nbsp;Nateland podcast. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"We were friends at Applebee’s and everyone was going out… after work, just friends. He put in The Little Mermaid soundtrack and told his friends to like, ‘Shush, shush. I’m listening to this song,’" she revealed.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Laura described finding Bargatze’s actions at the time as “totally confident” and “cool.” They began dating when he was 21 and he has joked about it in multiple instances.</p><p>On top of being the source of much of his comedic material, Laura has also played a very vital role in his success. Though the two got together before his career as a comic took off, she has supported him throughout his journey. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>According to her LinkedIn profile, she currently serves as a talent manager at Bargatze Enterprise. She is also an executive producer at Bargatze’s Nateland podcast. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Bargatze also joked about their bonding at Applebees in one of his stand-up routines. He said that his wife thought that he could never make it to the server because&nbsp;they had lots to remember.&nbsp;</p><h2>Nate Bargatze and his Wife welcomed their Daughter in 2012</h2><p>The <a href=# rel=follow>comedian</a> and his wife tied the knot on October 13, 2007. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>While he hasn’t revealed the exact date of their marriage, he wished her a happy 14th anniversary on the date in 2020.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>He also talked about holding his wedding on a particular date on one of his shows.</p><p>The comic <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">joked</a> about having an easy time securing a venue for his big day as no one had booked any hours for Friday the 13th. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Five years after their marriage, the pair welcomed their first and only child, daughter Harper Blair Bargatze, in 2012. She was the one to <a href=# rel="follow noopener">announce</a> her dad Nate Bargatze on his Netflix special, The Tennessee Kid.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><br><strong>Nate Bargatze with his daughter</strong> (Source:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p>Like him, she was born in Tennessee and it was one of the reasons why he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">named his Netflix comedy special</a> The Tennessee Kid.&nbsp;</p><p>"I guess you could say it’s me. Then again, it might be my daughter, too. I guess it’s both of us. We’re both Tennessee kids. Honestly, I just wanted to get ‘Tennessee’ in the title of the show," he revealed.</p><p>Aside from influencing the name of his show and frequently being the subject of his jokes, Harper has also made appearances in his Instagram posts.</p><p>She has appeared in several promotional videos for his shows and she even introduced him on The Tennessee Kid.</p><p>Bargatze regards his wife and daughter as his biggest fans and is happy that they are cool with his profession.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>How old is Nate Bargatze?&nbsp;</h2><p>As of writing,&nbsp;Nathanael "Nate" Bargatze is 44 years old. He was born on 25 March 1979 in <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Old Hickory</a>, Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.&nbsp;to Italian descent <a href=# rel=follow>father Stephen, a magician and motivational speaker who previously worked as a clown</a>,&nbsp;and mother Carole Bargatze.&nbsp;</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>What is Nate Bargatze's Net Worth?</h2><p>Bargatze's estimated net worth is $5 million dollar.&nbsp;Bargatze also runs a podcast caleed The Nateland Podcast, which he has been featured on his Youtube.</p><p>Bargatze had two stand-up albums, Yelled at by a Clown and Full Time Magic, and high-profile touring experiences before his half-hour special released on Netflix in 2017 as part of its comedy streaming project The&nbsp;Standups. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>While the half-hour special was a relative success, his 2019's released The Tennessee Kid and his 2022's release The Greatest Average American (nominated for 2022's Grammy)&nbsp;stand-up specials completely <a href=# rel="follow noopener">transformed</a> his career, as it brought him closer to a wider audience base that grew every day.&nbsp;</p><p>“The special has changed everything. Netflix is an unbelievable platform for stand-up comics. It just stays up there forever. Every day, you have people discovering you. It’s the best thing that has ever happened to me, except for my family,” Bargatze said of The Tennessee Kid.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2023, his <a href=# rel="follow noopener">The Be Funny tour</a> made the<a href=# rel="follow noopener"> venue's attendance record</a> with 19,365 people at the Bridgestone Arena.&nbsp;</p><p>In the distant past, he had several career experiences before pursuing a career in comedy. He did several stints during his college days, including working as a host at the dine-in restaurant Applebee's (where he met his wife).</p><p>Later, he was reading meters in Mt. Juliet when he decided that he would pursue comedy after a friend of his pitched the idea to him. After that, he took improv comedy classes&nbsp;with a friend at The Second City, moving to Chicago in 2002.</p><p>But he realized that his heart was set on standup comedy and switched to its classes from improv. The next two years after that, he performed in open mics before moving to New York in 2004 to make it big, partly inspired by Jerry Seinfeld's Comedian (2002), a re-invention documentary about the famous comedian's return to comedy clubs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The tour will run till December 2023 in diverse places across the United States&nbsp;and the tickets ( price $35 up and below $100) are available on his website <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Natebargatze Live</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKaRqbJursCrnpqsqpp6uLXFnmWhrJ2h</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnate-bargatze-wife-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnate-bargatze-wife-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnate-bargatze-wife-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnate-bargatze-wife-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnate-bargatze-wife-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnate-bargatze-wife-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kylie-jenner-thinner-waist-leather-dress-pout-new-video.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kylie-jenner-thinner-waist-leather-dress-pout-new-video.html>Kylie Jenner flaunts her thinner-than-ever waist in tight leather dress as she shows off her huge po</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./cynthia-rothrock.html>Fame | Cynthia Rothrock net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./cynthia-rothrock.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
