Despite the challenges she faced, Lucille instilled a strong work ethic and a desire to succeed in her children.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>She was also a driving factor in Shaquille's basketball career — and eventual success —&nbsp;encouraging him to pursue the sport and guiding him along the way. Later in life, Lucille met Army Sergeant Phillip Harrison, and the two got married, with Phillip becoming a father figure to Shaq and his three siblings.</p><p>So, it is no surprise that when he made it into the NBA, he put his mom and his stepfather on his payroll, paying his mom a salary of $750,000.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"So, [the] first thing I did was incorporate ‘Shaq’ and then I put my mom on salary and put my dad on salary. And you know, we had a fan club. I got ’em an office and got ’em a car and they were so proud," Shaq told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Afrotech</a> in 2022. "Cause the best day of my life was when I got drafted."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">It was actually Shaq's stepfather Phillip who introduced him to basketball.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Shaq has made no secret about the fact that his stepfather, Philip, was the one who introduced him to basketball. The celebrated NBA hall-of-famer did not always dream of being in the NBA, but after a trip to Madison Square Garden with Philip to watch Julius Erving play, he became inspired to pursue basketball.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Before then, Shaq was reportedly a troubled kid, who was "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">more into football</a>" initially, as he put it but because Shaq's biological father was absent, Phillip became more than a father figure to Shaq.</p><p>Over the years, the NBA leaguer and DJ has praised his stepfather’s influence in his life and credited him for shaping him into the man that he is today. Phillip passed away in 2013.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“He’s the guy that told me one day that I would be here,” Shaq said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in a speech during All-Star Weekend</a> in 2022. “I was a medium-level, high-level juvenile delinquent, was always told I would never ever make it. He convinced me to do well in school ... I look at him and say ‘Sir, this is what I want to be when I grow up.' His exact words, 'If you listen to me, I’ll make you one of those most dominant big men ever.'"</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Despite his absence, Shaq says he doesn't judge his biological father.</h2><p>Joseph Toney — Shaq's biological father — spent nearly six years in prison, leaving his family behind. After he was released, his son [Shaquille] and Lucille moved to Germany with Lucille's new partner Philip Harrison, who was an Army man.</p><p>According to several reports, for years, Joseph made no attempt to reconnect with Shaq and Lucille. It wasn't until after Phillip Harrison — who had forbidden Joe's efforts to reunite with his son Shaq and former wife — passed away that he was finally able to try.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>On Dr. Phil, Shaq opened up about meeting his father for the first time at 44 years old.</p><p>"I don't judge. He had some problems when he was young. I don't judge him. I don't fault him," he told the talk show host. "My thing now is just as long as we're both here, we just get to know each other. I'm not the judge and the jury. My job is just to love him as much as I can now."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">According to Shaq, his parents are also the reason he is a successful entrepreneur.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Shaq, who has six kids of his own, has always been vocal about the significance of his parents' influence on his early life. In a conversation with a group of kids, <a href=#>the savvy businessman</a> and renowned sports icon said that he grew his stellar fortune because he listened to his parents.</p><p>“You know how I made $900 million? Just by listening to my mommy and daddy," Shaq <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>. "Make sure you always listen to your parents. Got it? I’m serious. I’m not playing. Alright? Don’t tell anybody else my secret.
