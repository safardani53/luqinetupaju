He tells the worker that he can't wait to "post it online" to which the greeter says, "post it."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>A manager then approaches Travis and the Walmart greeter.

"He cannot do that legally it is against the law," he tells the manager, who sends the greeter away to separate himself from the situation.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>After checking Travis' receipt and seeing that everything is on the up and up, the manager hands it back to him and then follows the TikToker out to his car.</p><p>In a follow-up video, the TikToker gave more insight into what happened.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Yesterday I went to Walmart and got diesel exhaust fluid and 4 gallons of windshield wiper fluid. Instead of going to self checkout I went to the cashier the cashier that I went to was closest to the exit where Chuck was working. There's no doubt in my mind that Chuck did not see me just leave the cashier."</p><p>He continues, "I'm on my way out I'm on the phone, Chuck wants to see my receipt. I tell Chuck thank you I just don't have time today and I tried to walk past him Chuck jumps in front puts his hands on my car I asked him to please move and he refused I get off the phone and I start recording because it's important that we document these situations."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"It prevents us from losing our anger and we can also show our side of the story. I asked Chuck to get a manager and he said no you go get a manager. That's not my job. I don't know who the manager is why would I go get a manager for you. So I tried to go around him. Chuck continued to place himself in front of my car and would not let me leave."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He says things like we can do this all day and you're not leaving the store. He also allowed other people to leave without checking their receipts. That's not right. Chuck cannot prevent you from leaving the store Chuck cannot detain you if he thinks that you're stealing something he can follow you to your car take down your license plate number he can call the police check the cameras call security. He is not a security guard he is not a police officer he can absolutely not detain you."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aisle of Shame</a> writes that it is illegal for store greeters to stop you and that customers are allowed to walk right on past them or refuse to show them their receipt if they choose to do so. The outlet states: "You can ignore the greeter and walk on if you want to. If the greeter stops you or forces you to show the receipt, they may violate your rights."</p><p>Travis adds, "I purchased the things I wanted to leave I was on a time crunch I had the right to leave," and he adds that while he followed up with Walmart to see what kind of disciplinary action was being taken against the worker, Chuck, he learned that he was given a warning. However, the TikToker noted that Chuck was still working the door, and seeing as the had an unfortunate interaction with him at the part of the store, the TikToker said it was probably a bad idea to keep him working there.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrK6tucCrq2abpajBsLnEq2Sam5OqwKa%2FjLCmq6OVp3qwsoyhpqWcmaO0bsDHnqRmoJ%2BowaKzxA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwalmart-customer-accuses-worker-of-holding-them-hostage.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwalmart-customer-accuses-worker-of-holding-them-hostage.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwalmart-customer-accuses-worker-of-holding-them-hostage.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwalmart-customer-accuses-worker-of-holding-them-hostage.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwalmart-customer-accuses-worker-of-holding-them-hostage.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwalmart-customer-accuses-worker-of-holding-them-hostage.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./love-is-blind-on-netflix-are-lauren-and-cameron-still-together-instagram-reveals-all.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./love-is-blind-on-netflix-are-lauren-and-cameron-still-together-instagram-reveals-all.html>Netflix: Meet Love Is Blinds Lauren Speed Instagram, career and wedding with Cameron Thu</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./girl-wears-australian-firefighter-dads-helmet-at-funeral.html>Girl Wears Australian Firefighter Dad's Helmet at His Funeral</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./girl-wears-australian-firefighter-dads-helmet-at-funeral.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
