We were attending the hospital to bring a child into our care.</p><p>"To charge a funeral director who is simply bringing a child into care is just totally disgusting.</p><p>"They know that we're at the mortuary and a children's hospital is the last place you think you'd want to profiteer from. We don't charge for a child under the age of 16.</p><p>"I've spent 36 years in the funeral industry and I thought nothing would surprise me, ever."</p><h2>'DISGUSTING'</h2><p>The 54-year-old added: "We parked up, went into the hospital and spent around 20 minutes there.</p><p>"You're supposed to be out in ten minutes but with the best will in the world, you can't be held to the minute when you're doing something like that.</p><p>"Sometimes it takes a little longer. When you're dealing with a child who has passed away, you don't just walk in and walk straight back out."</p><p>A spokesman for the Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust said the fine had now been removed.</p><p>They said: "As soon as this was brought to our attention, we contacted the company that handles our car parking and the fine was immediately cancelled.</p><p>"Fines can be appealed, and in legitimate cases like this we will ensure no fine is paid.</p><p>"We will be reviewing our processes to avoid a similar situation in future."</p><p>But Mr Fogg said the fine should never have been issued in the first place.</p><p>He said: "You can quite clearly see on the picture that the van says 'private ambulance'. Someone will have seen that and still decided to print [the fine] out.</p><p>"We are not there to park and then go shopping. We are there to bring a six-year-old girl into our care who has just passed away.</p><p>"We don’t profit out of a child passing away so why should anyone else?</p><p>"It's not a lot of money but if this is not highlighted then this could go on and on and on."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>Earlier this year Mr Fogg <a href=#>stumped up the cash to bring comedian Freddie Starr's body back to the UK for a proper burial</a>.</p><p>Mr Fogg said it was an honour to help the star, who wanted to be buried close to his mum in Liverpool.</p><p>It had been feared that <a href=#>Freddie</a> - who was estranged from his family and had become a penniless recluse - would get a pauper's funeral in Spain, where he lived.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sheffield1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fogg3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000069391513.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZn1yf5ZxcG1nlqeypbDInmSsrJGnv7R5xa6lnqqRoXqltdGemq2nomLAra3PqZydZaeewal5z5qppKGenHqntc2eZJqsXZ28tLzIrZilZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffreddie-starrs-funeral-director-slapped-with-parking-fine-at-hospital.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffreddie-starrs-funeral-director-slapped-with-parking-fine-at-hospital.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffreddie-starrs-funeral-director-slapped-with-parking-fine-at-hospital.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffreddie-starrs-funeral-director-slapped-with-parking-fine-at-hospital.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffreddie-starrs-funeral-director-slapped-with-parking-fine-at-hospital.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffreddie-starrs-funeral-director-slapped-with-parking-fine-at-hospital.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jane-hanson-19551209-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jane-hanson-19551209-html.html>Jane Hanson (TV Show Host) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-stevie-baggs-dating.html>Who is Stevie Baggs Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-stevie-baggs-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
