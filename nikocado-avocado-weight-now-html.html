The better—he is getting increasingly popular because of his emotionally charged mukbang&nbsp;eating content. His four Youtube channel, Nikocado Avocado, Nikocado Avocado 2, Nikocado Avocado 3, and More Nikocado, now has over 5.5 million followers. The worse—he has gained over 200 pounds, resulting in diabetes and possibly other conditions associated with being overweight. And the YouTuber has no intention of stopping anytime soon.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Comparing his before and after body size, he now looks more bulkier and round.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Nikocado Avocado's before and after weight</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Many fans online have placed their concerns on his increasing weight caused by his excessive intake of fast foods for his Youtube mukbang videos. A classically trained violinist, Perry initially started as a vegan when he began his YouTube career. But two years down the line, he stopped being a vegan due to various health hazards.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Nikocado Avocado.&nbsp;(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</strong><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>He said he developed hypoglycemia, a vitamin B-12 deficiency, and a rotted tooth between 2014 and 2016. He did not blame veganism for being sick but said he had never had these before.</p><p>In 2016, he discovered the mukbang community on the platform and indulged in it. His <a href=# rel="follow noopener">extreme eating</a> and mental breakdowns garnered him a lot of fans.&nbsp;</p><h2>Avocado has no plans to get skinny...what is his weight?</h2><p>He has also had several health issues, such as diabetes, excessive coughing, and breaking three ribs.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But to date, the YouTuber has no plans to stop despite talking numerous times in his videos about food sensibility, movability issues, weight issues, and other health-associated conditions such as diabetes and even heart attacks.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>&nbsp;According to an<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Internet analyst's video</a>, Perry is seen saying he weighed around 150-160 lbs&nbsp;before.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Since he started doing mukbangs, he has kept track of his weight gain. Now, he weighs over 368&nbsp;lbs. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p></p><p><strong>Nikocado Avocado.&nbsp;(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>Nikocado Avocado's weight gain explained</h2><p>On December 18, 2021, Perry <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">uploaded a new video</a> on his&nbsp;More Nikocado channel titled, 'Heart Attack Grill • 20,000 Calorie Burger • MUKBANG." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He went to the Heart Attack Grill, where you can eat all&nbsp;for free if you weigh more than 350 lbs. Perry has mentioned that he wanted to weigh over 350 lbs&nbsp;for the past few years.</p><p>Now, he believed he had reached his goal, so he wanted to go to the restaurant to eat for free. So he talked with the workers in the restaurant and told them his plans — to get weighed and eat for free.&nbsp;</p><p>He got on the weighing machine with his back turned to the numbers. To his surprise and delight, he weighed around 356&nbsp;lbs.</p><p>People cheered for him as he reached his goal, so he got to eat for free. He ate over 20,000 calories of food at the Heart Attack Grill.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After eating the food, he returned to the weighing machine to check his weight. Within a few hours, while he ate the food, Perry gained 9 lbs and weighed 364 lbs.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>Then after, the video's comment section got full of worried fans and followers. Many pointed out that congratulating Perry for being over 350 lbs was problematic and disturbing.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>They also noted that the YouTuber should not be encouraged to eat excessively, which might harm his health. Similarly, many wondered if he had developed an <a href=# rel=follow>eating disorder</a> over the past few years.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>While the fans are worried, Perry is not concerned enough to acutely act on a healthy lifestyle or work on reducing weight. Previously, he had mentioned that after he reached his goal weight, he would start losing it.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it is upon the YouTuber he chooses to do so or not in 2023, as this year has been "another year of no weight loss," as per his partner Orlin Holme, who made fun of Avocado with the comment in one of his recent videos.&nbsp;</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Nikocado Avocado's death rumors circulated in July 2022</h2><p>In July 2022, news began swirling around the internet that Nicholas had <a href=# rel="follow noopener">died</a> since he had been missing on social media. However, his husband, Orlin Holme, later silenced the rumor revealing that Nicholas&nbsp;wasn't dead. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>He clarified that Avocado was&nbsp;alive and busy caring for "personal issues." In the Instagram post, he also disclosed that he had decided to split after six years of a relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>Their separation has been a theme in their mukbang posts for a while. Their videos are usually accompanied by titles suggesting their break up and separation. Both have also commented about cheating on one another in their videos.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the pair have managed to stick together despite their life disagreements and issues.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Who is Nikocado Avocado's husband, Orlin Holme?</h2><p><a href=# rel="follow noopener">Orlin Holme</a>, whose real name is Rodrigo Gonzalez, is Columbian, has also achieved relative popularity from his appearance in Avocado's videos. He is known for his heated chemistry with Avocado. In their mutual appearance, he often criticizes Avocado for his lifestyle choices with his sarcastic one-liners. He usually assists Avocado in his mukbang adventures.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>Holme has his own Youtube channel, in which he has amassed over 290 thousand followers. He also posts videos on mukbangs, his personal life, and his relationship with Avocado.&nbsp;</p><p>The pair first met in a Facebook group for Vegan men. After that, they started dating and remained in a relationship for a while before tying the knot in 2017. They have had ups and down in their rocky relationship over the years and have posted about the split multiple times on their social media accounts.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is Nikocado Avocado's age?</h2><p>At the time of writing, Avocado is 30 years old. He was born in Ukraine but later <a href=# rel="follow noopener">adopted by an American family.</a>&nbsp;He started his Youtube career in 2014 as a vegan vlogger but later changed his path after leaving veganism due to his deteriorating. He then discovered mukbang forums and content and decided to do it himself for success and popularity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKaZoLykrcOoZJqun5iupbuMsJyin5ipeq%2B71mefraWc</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnikocado-avocado-weight-now-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnikocado-avocado-weight-now-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnikocado-avocado-weight-now-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnikocado-avocado-weight-now-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnikocado-avocado-weight-now-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnikocado-avocado-weight-now-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./vanessa-hudgens-cow-print-bikini-pumpkin-patch-halloween-pics.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./vanessa-hudgens-cow-print-bikini-pumpkin-patch-halloween-pics.html>Vanessa Hudgens Rocks Cow Print Bikini &amp;amp; Lays In Pumpkin Patch Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sex-toy-use-cleaning.html>Im a sexpert - heres why you should NEVER use sex toys two days in a row (even if you clean th</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sex-toy-use-cleaning.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
