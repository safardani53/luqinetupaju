They welcomed one daughter, Fernanda Luisa Gordon, and were married for 45 years until Gordon's death in 2010.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While their decades-long marriage appeared to be a happy one from the outside, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>West Side Story</a> star has opened up about her late husband and the ups and downs they faced in the years since his death.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the documentary Rita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go For It, Moreno shared that Gordon was often a "controller" and that she hid some of the truths about her marriage to keep up appearances. "[After he died] I thought, 'It's over. I don't have to answer to anybody anymore,' " she said in the film, per <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>USA Today</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since his passing, Moreno has said she has no interest in marrying again, even once telling PEOPLE that she would rather "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>eat glass</a>" than walk down the aisle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I come from an era where you were supposed to obey the man in the family," she added of her marriage. "I didn't know how to write a check for the longest time ... it's a silent pact that people very often make."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">These days, though, Moreno is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>happier than she's ever been</a>. "I'm still active and still working," she told PEOPLE in June 2021. "I worry and stress a lot less now because I'm so grateful. I stop and smell the roses."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading for everything there is to know about Leonard Gordon, the late husband of award-winning actress Rita Moreno.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-he-was-born-in-new-york-and-worked-as-a-doctor></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>He was born in New York and worked as a doctor</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ron Galella/Ron Galella Collection/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gordon was born in March 1920 in New York City.

Fernanda was one of the main reasons Moreno decided to stay in the marriage; she didn't want to split up her family. "The thought of making her do without her daddy was anathema to me," she later told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Vanity Fair</a> of her rationale at the time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fernanda has two sons, Cameron and Justin. "They are my heart and soul. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Family is what keeps me alive</a> and happy," Moreno told PEOPLE in 2021 of her daughter and grandsons. "Regrets are a waste of time. To waste precious time on them, especially as you get older, is truly obscene, when there's so much beauty and love and humor in this world."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-moreno-considered-gordon-controlling></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Moreno considered Gordon controlling</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ralph Dominguez/MediaPunch/Alamy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the decades since his death, the actress has been much more open about her feelings toward her late husband. "The day I wanted to start growing up is when my marriage really became torture for me. And for him," she told the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>New Yorker</a> in 2021. "My husband was a terrific man, just not a good husband. He was a controller."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Moreno added that she would never have shared these feelings publicly while Gordon was alive — much less in a documentary. "I would never have talked about him without his permission. I couldn't do that," Moreno explained in a post-premiere Q&A session, per USA Today. "And it's entirely possible and probable that he would have said, 'What? Are you crazy? No you cannot.' In a way, having the freedom to do it was really very important to me because we ran quite an extraordinary and successful charade for many years."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-despite-her-feelings-moreno-says-gordon-was-a-wonderful-person></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Despite her feelings, Moreno says Gordon was "a wonderful person"</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ralph Dominguez/MediaPunch/Alamy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After reflecting on her marriage in her documentary, Moreno called Gordon "wonderful" but realized she would have preferred to have been single. "It was just that our marriage didn't work out. I didn't realize how desperately I needed to be on my own," the 80 for Brady star <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told reporters</a> at the documentary's premiere. "I really didn't realize how I was punishing myself by not being on my own."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also called him "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the love of her life</a>," though she considers Brando the "lust of [her] life."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-moreno-was-with-him-right-until-the-end-of-his-life></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Moreno was with him right until the end of his life</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Alberto E.

"I was with him to the very last, including a month in hospital where I slept on a cot and was with him 24/7," she said in a 2021 interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Guardian</a>. "It's what you do when you love and respect somebody."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Gordon died in June 2010, Moreno felt "liberated" and ready for a new chapter. "I got up, cut a lock of his hair, which I still have – beautiful silver hair – and as I left I stopped at the door and I looked at him," she shared. "He was so small and slender and white, and I thought: 'How is it that little wizened person made me so unhappy? Where did he get that power?' It was a mystery to me."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ52kw6qx0miuoaddrK60ecuepqeZopl6qLvRnaanZaKewaJ5zKipnqafYrW2v8GapZ1n</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-was-leonard-gordon-rita-moreno-husband.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-was-leonard-gordon-rita-moreno-husband.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-was-leonard-gordon-rita-moreno-husband.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-was-leonard-gordon-rita-moreno-husband.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-was-leonard-gordon-rita-moreno-husband.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-was-leonard-gordon-rita-moreno-husband.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bette-midlers-husband-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bette-midlers-husband-list.html>Bette Midlers Husband: Who is Bette Midler Dating?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-pasha-harulia-dating.html>Who is Pasha Harulia Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-pasha-harulia-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
