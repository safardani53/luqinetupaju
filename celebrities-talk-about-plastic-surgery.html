Rather than denying the mounting rumors, Tisdale came clean: "I want my fans to know the truth. I'm not someone who is going to act like I had nothing done. I just want to be honest because my fans are everything to me," she said.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-kourtney-kardashian></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Kourtney Kardashian</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Gabe Ginsberg/FilmMagic</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I have had breast implants, but it's so funny 'cause it's not a secret.

She then mocked a tabloid for getting the timeline of the procedure completely wrong: "It's so funny because the 'before' picture that they showed was after I had my boob job, so I'm like, they should have written 'before Mason' and 'after Mason.'

When she was 26, Griffin had her nose done because she had been told repeatedly, "You would be pretty if it weren't for that nose. You'd work more if it weren't for that nose." In her 2009 memoir, Official Book Club Selection: A Memoir According to Kathy Griffin, she revealed that complications from a liposuction procedure almost killed her. She wrote: "I want women to know that this is what lipo looks like. Like, are you sure you don't want to just work out a little more?"</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-patricia-heaton></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Patricia Heaton</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Robin Marchant/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's better to be honest if you can.

"If anybody says their face-lift doesn't hurt they're lying. It was like I'd spent the night with an ax murderer.

I went from, in my mind, hideous, to not hideous," she told The Saturday Evening Post in 2013. "I did it the summer before going to a new high school. So there were plenty of people who wouldn't know how hideous I looked before."
