I don’t really want to stare at dk for a long period of time. “I don’t f with foreplay, as everyone will tell you, even in my business I do not like to tease things.</p><p>“But I could definitely have foreplay longer with a girl than I could with a guy. Girls are way hotter.</p><p>“But everyone I think can agree that from ancient times, d**ks make wonderful sculpture, but more than that, I am not as interested.</p><p>“It’s good if he can just get in and go away because I don’t want it eyeing me off.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000512753795.jpg><p>“Everyone knows that ts are prettier than balls. Everybody knows this.”</p><p>Even so, at the moment, Miley insists she doesn’t have time for long sex sessions because she is too focused on her music.</p><p>She added: “I’ve given a b**w job recently but it wasn’t as much fun as I thought it was going to be. It honestly just took too long. I am so f***ing busy.”</p><p>And she loves collecting sex toys — though she doesn’t buy them to use them.</p><p>Miley said: “Most of my sex toys I use as interior design.</p><p>“A lot of the time I’ll buy a dildo and more than about its operation, it’s like I love the way it looks on the wall.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000535916181.jpg><p>“I like vibrators but I mostly just like the aesthetic and I feel like I’m pretty good at dealing with myself.”</p><p>Today Miley announced she had split up with singer Cody Simpson after almost a year together.</p><p>On the subject of when she first had sex with a man, she said: “I was 16 but I ended up marrying the guy. So that’s pretty crazy.”</p><p>She is referring to actor Liam Hemsworth, whom she dated on and off for a decade before tying the knot at the end of 2018, then splitting eight months later, last August.</p><p>Reflecting on their separation publicly for the first time, Miley revealed to the Call Her Daddy podcast that she was the one to end it.</p><p>She went on: “It’s like a death when you lose a love that deep — it feels like a death. Sometimes that even feels easier.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/555d90f9-77bd-48fc-a6cd-bc9342686275.jpg><p>“The person’s still walking on the earth and choosing every day, because it’s a choice.</p><p>“Death isn’t even a choice and this is a choice.”</p><p>Miley went on: “At first when I got out of my long-time relationship and it didn’t work, that was really traumatising.</p><p>“Now I’m in a place where I just look at it and love it and respect it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3c0e4d70-2a56-4c60-a747-f677e25666c3.jpg><p>She added: “The relationship that I had for ten years was an amazing time in my life.</p><p>“And the relationship I had with myself as Hannah Montana and all that — that was a great time in my life.</p><p>“I loved working with my dad (Billy Ray Cyrus) every day.</p><p>“At the time I didn’t know how lucky I was.”</p><p>The singer went on: “All the times in my life, even the times that have been not the best, somehow added up to now and I love who I am right now.</p><p>“If any of those things hadn’t happened, I’m not sure I’d be the same person, so I’m just super stoked.”</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Eighties treat so sweet</h3></p><p>MILEY returned today with her first single in a year — called Midnight Sky and inspired by the Eighties.</p><p>The superstar, who wore several striking outfits and rolled in a pool of sweets in the eye-catching video, explained: “I wanted a song which felt classic.</p><p>“I wanted a song that felt like it was from the era which I usually pull my inspiration from – but really not being afraid, really being unapologetic about the tone, the sonics and the lyrics.”</p><p>Miley hasn’t just made an Eighties-inspired song — she’s also got a mullet to match.</p><p>She said: “When I cut my hair, I told my mum, ‘Make me look like Rod Stewart’.” But the track may not end up on a new album. On where she is at the moment musically, she added: “I really have always enjoyed dropping singles rather than the full body of work, because it allows you to talk to your fans in real time.</p><p>“When you write a record, a lot of the time you’re writing your experiences, and then by the time the record comes out, you’ve evolved past that experience.”</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">bizbit</h3></p><p>WOMEN in a Connecticut town are leaving home-made muffins outside a house where Bradley Cooper is believed to be staying.</p><p>A local said: “They request he returns the dish personally.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>James' skit not suited to Becks</h2><p>DAVID Beckham showed once again why he should stick to kicking a football and not acting as he and James Corden dressed up in Miami Vice-style suits for a sketch on The Late Late Show.</p><p>The ex-England captain rode a tandem and sparred at a boxing club with his talk show host pal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000601931592.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000601906440.jpg><p>Goldenballs also took James to a spin class while subtly wearing the gear of his football team Inter Miami.</p><p>Taking over the class, James played Wannabe by Becks’ wife Victoria's old group The Spice Girls and made an embarrassing attempt at singing along and dancing to the track.</p><p>At one point David told James to “f*** off” when he gave him some instructions.</p><p>It all brought back horror memories of David’s part in Guy Ritchie’s flop 2017 film King Arthur.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">bizbit</h3></p><p>MADONNA is due to host a party at Round Hill Hotel and Villas in Montego Bay, Jamaica, for her 62nd birthday tomorrow, say US sources.</p><p>But best friend and manager Guy Oseary says she won’t be there due to Covid-19.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Tat for new tot</h2><p>ED Sheeran is planning a tattoo tribute to his baby and will get inked as soon as the tot is born.</p><p>The Shape Of You singer and wife Cherry Seaborn are expecting their first child this summer, as I first revealed on Wednesday.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000472599041-3.jpg><p>Tattooist Kevin Paul, who has done more than 40 of Ed’s tattoos, has revealed the pop star “has always planned to get tattoos for his kids”.</p><p>In an exclusive interview, he explained: “Ed hasn’t said what he will get — I’m sure that will be down to if it’s a boy or a girl and what they end up naming them.</p><p>“I’m sure he will do something pretty bonkers like the rest of his tattoos!
