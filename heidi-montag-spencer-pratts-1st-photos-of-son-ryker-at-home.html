It just feels very different and easier.”</p><p><a href=#>Us broke the news</a> in June that the <a href=#>Hills</a> alum was pregnant after experiencing <a href=#>fertility challenges</a>. She gave birth to Ryker on November 17, and the infant already has “a great temperament.”</p><p>Montag and her husband, 39, are still working on finding “a rhythm as a family of four,” she tells Us, but <a href=#>the parenting process has been “a little bit easier”</a> this time around. However, the couple are working hard to make sure Gunner doesn’t feel left out.</p><p>“[I’m] juggling the heartstrings with Gunner and making sure I have that time with him. … Mom guilt is something I’m really trying to balance,” the “More Is More” singer explains. “It’s just more people to worry about constantly. … I do just love Gunner and Ryker so differently, but it’s equal. I just feel really whole.”</p><p>Despite the slight challenges that come with being the mother of two, <a href=#>Montag couldn’t be happier</a> with how her family is growing. “I always dreamed of [having boys],” she says. “That’s what I always wanted growing up whenever anyone asked me. [I’d say], ‘Oh, I want three boys.’ Now — <a href=#>including my husband</a> — I have the three boys.”</p><p>The<a href=#> Celebrity Big Brother</a> alum isn’t letting all the male energy get to her, though. “I’m definitely the queen of the castle,” she tells Us. “I’m just so excited for Gunner to have a brother. I just think that’s such a special relationship.”</p><p>Throughout her pregnancy, Montag and Pratt <a href=#>kept fans in the loop</a> via social media and frequently gave updates on the Colorado native’s progress — even as she went into labor. The <a href=#>Laguna Beach</a> alum recorded a TikTok video from the hospital last month and <a href=#>had a glam session</a> shortly before she gave birth.</p><p>“What I wanted the whole time during my pregnancy — my dream scenario that I prayed for — [was this]: I want to <a href=#>get my makeup done in the morning</a> and I want to drop Gunner off at school and that would be ideal for me,” she tells Us. “So I went to drop him off at school and I’m having contractions. … I go home and my water partially breaks.”</p><p>Montag recalls asking her mother and the Pratt Daddy founder for advice as she continued experiencing contractions. “I called [Spencer] and I’m like, ‘I think we need to go to the hospital.’ So right when he gets [home], I’m having the craziest contractions. I can hardly even talk to him. He got here in 10 minutes. Thank God,” she says. “And I’m like bracing myself in the car … I was so glad he came home and I got my glam done. I was like, ‘Now I’m officially ready!'”</p><p>When it came to welcoming her second child, <a href=#>the MTV personality didn’t want to “be less glam”</a> than she was when Gunner arrived. “I wanted to look good and feel good,” she explains to Us, revealing that her sons <a href=#>happened to be delivered</a> in the same hospital room. “Spencer was like, ‘I’m calling for the sound bath.’ She got there right at the very end, the minute [Ryker] came out. It was crazy.</p><p>Montag adds: “I was supposed to get a massage at the house, so I called her [and said], ‘Just meet me at the hospital!’ … It was so intense.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Scroll down for exclusive photos of Montag, Pratt and their two sons — and pick up the latest issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands now, for even more.</p><p>With reporting by Andrea Simpson</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNktaa1w6Jkpqeeqa6oedKpnKeblad6sb7ArausZWGowW68x6irqKtdpLNuv86nZKuxm5q%2Fbq3TZp%2BopZVk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheidi-montag-spencer-pratts-1st-photos-of-son-ryker-at-home.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fheidi-montag-spencer-pratts-1st-photos-of-son-ryker-at-home.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fheidi-montag-spencer-pratts-1st-photos-of-son-ryker-at-home.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fheidi-montag-spencer-pratts-1st-photos-of-son-ryker-at-home.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheidi-montag-spencer-pratts-1st-photos-of-son-ryker-at-home.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheidi-montag-spencer-pratts-1st-photos-of-son-ryker-at-home.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./cocktail-recipe-book.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./cocktail-recipe-book.html>Hottest Cocktail Recipe Books of 2023 Hollywood Life Reviews Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./bake-off-sandro-topless-rebs.html>Bake Off's Sandro drives fans wild as he strips topless - after sparking romance rumours with Rebs</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./bake-off-sandro-topless-rebs.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
