Kelly are being reexamined in the wake of further damning claims against the singer - who is due to stand trial for allegedly heading up a sex cult.</strong></p><p>The R&B hitmaker, real name Robert Sylvester Kelly, 54, will appear before courts in Brooklyn, New York, and refutes all of the sex trafficking and racketeering charges.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/d84082df-4fda-4b39-ac16-2b6d1215ba7b.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/de619ca6-cb8f-47eb-add4-b2cf9181e40f.jpg><p>These are the latest in a flurry of allegations to be made against <a href=#>Kelly</a>, who along with employees and his entourage, is accused of having “preyed upon women and girls who attended his concerts”.</p><p>It’s claimed they were made to “be available to engage in illegal sexual activity with him at a moment’s notice” and were not allowed to “leave their room without permission”.</p><p>Since the two-part documentary series Surviving R. Kelly aired, many have poured over the singer’s life for clues to hint at the behaviour he is accused of.&nbsp;</p><p>Some raised concerns after reexamining lyrics from 17 studio albums and 119 singles in the wake of the most recent allegations.&nbsp;</p><h2>Sexual desires lyrics</h2><p>Jerhonda Pace claimed she had underage sex with Kelly in 2008 and that she was groomed to become part of his alleged sex cult.</p><p>On TV show The Real in 2017, she spoke out and said a female trainer taught her how to “please him” - referring to Kelly - and showed her specific sex acts to do with Kelly.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The US Sun</h2></p><p>In Kelly’s 1993 track ‘12 Play’, he seemed to divulge sexual desires in a list of instructions including: “Seven: Spread your legs apart; Eight: Feel me so hard.”</p><p>Other lyrics included, “Nine: See I want you from behind”, “Ten: Baby climb on top of me” and “Eleven: Up and down we’ll go, you’ll see”.</p><h2>‘Young maid every hour’</h2><p>In the 1998 song ‘If I’m Wit’ You’, which featured on album R, Kelly referred to “young” women.&nbsp;</p><p>Kelly sings: “It really don’t matter who’s first in the shower; Fruit platter from a young maid every hour.”</p><p>The lyrics were seen as controversial to some after the musician faced allegations of sexual misconduct with women and young women in the Nineties.&nbsp;</p><p>During that period, Kelly married his 15-year-old protege Aaliyah Haughton - who claimed she was 18 during the ceremony but was later discovered to be underage.</p><p>Jovante Cunningham, a former backup singer, who met the singer at the age of 14, claimed to have witnessed Kelly having sex with the teen and other underage girls.</p><p>Haughton, who was married to Kelly between 1994 and 1995, died in a plane crash in 2001.</p><p>Through his lawyers this year, the singer admitted to having had “underage sexual contact” with the teenager.</p><h2>‘Referred to himself as Daddy’</h2><p>In 2018, Faith A. Rodgers spoke out after having a one-year relationship with Kelly, when she was 19 years old.</p><p>She sued the singer after claiming he had “willfully, deliberately and maliciously” infected her with herpes, filmed her during sex without her consent and other charges.</p><p>Faith told the BBC that she “wasn’t ready for sex” and that Kelly said “nasty, degrading things” to her and referred to himself as “Daddy”.</p><p>The nickname appeared in his 1995 hit ‘Tempo Slow’, in which he sang: “Baby tell Daddy what it is you want.”</p><p>Kelly’s attorney rejected the allegations made by Rodgers, who is believed to be part of a federal court case against the singer.</p><p>The lawyer claimed to be unaware of the “lies and distortions” about his client and argued that accusers were “profiteers” and “not victims”.</p><p>They continued: “Both of these women are simply out to exploit their past connection to R. Kelly.”</p><h2>‘Lock up your body’</h2><p>Jerhonda Pace has also claimed Kelly physically abused her and would lock her in a bedroom for several days at a time - something other women previously alleged.</p><p>It followed accounts of a “sex dungeon” at a music studio, within an industrial property in Chicago, that had living quarters for young women.</p><p>Pace claimed to have felt trapped and said she was only allowed to leave with Kelly’s permission.</p><p>In Surviving R. Kelly, she claimed to have escaped after making up a lie about retrieving shoes ahead of a party and fleeing.&nbsp;</p><p>Some have made connections with the allegations of entrapment - which Kelly denies - and the 2000 song ‘R&B Thug’.</p><p>In the lyrics, he sang: “Lock your body up and throw away the key.”</p><h2>‘Feast your body all night’</h2><p>In previous years, fans believed lyrics from the 2000 hit ‘The Greatest Sex’ could have referred to Kelly’s underage lover Aaliyah.</p><p>Their suspicions arose after he referenced a mystery Capricorn - the star sign of his late ex-wife - who appeared to please him.</p><p>The lyrics read: “And inside of your walls there will dwell a Capricorn; That will feast your body all night.”</p><p>Sources close to Kelly claimed that during their relationship he was concerned about having impregnated the young singer.&nbsp;</p><p>In Surviving R. Kelly, former personal assistant Demetrius Smith said the singer admitted it to him after telling him “we got Aaliyah in trouble”.</p><p>Some speculated the pregnancy could have been referenced in the performer’s 2005 song ‘Trapped In The Closet, Chapter 4’.</p><p>He sang: “That's when I started going crazy like I was tryna give her a baby… Then I flipped back the cover; O my god a rubber.”</p><h2>‘A trip to planet Uranus’</h2><p>Kelly is well-known for his highly sexualised lyrics and double entendres.</p><p>They include in the 2007 song ‘Sex Planet’, which included the words: “Girl I promise this will be painless, painless; We’ll take a trip to planet Uranus.”&nbsp;</p><p>Some believed lyrics in ‘Taxi Cab’, which came out in 2010, showed Kelly liked having sex in vehicles.</p><p>In the song, he sang: “Looking at the rearview she said to me, let go and be free; Then she told the driver mind his business and then went there on me.</p><p>“Then I told her we’re just 15 minutes from my home; But she didn’t stop, she kept saying it feels so incredibly wrong.”&nbsp;</p><p>This was linked to Cunningham’s claims in Surving R. Kelly, where she claimed to have witnessed the singer “having sex with Aaliyah” on a tour bus.</p><p>She claimed Aaliyah was underage at the time and said Kelly was doing “things that an adult should not be doing with a child”.</p><h2>‘I made some mistakes’</h2><p>In the 2018 song ‘I Admit’, Kelly denounced allegations made against him - and has continued to do so in court.</p><p>He addressed many of the claims including those that suggested he was the leader of a “sex cult” and others that referenced the “abuse” of women.&nbsp;</p><p>In one lyric, he sang: “What’s the definition of a cult?; What’s the definition of a sex slave?”</p><p>Later in the song, Kelly said: “Go to the dictionary, look it up; Let me know, I’ll be here waiting.”</p><p>Kelly also referenced claims of him “abusing these women” and responded:&nbsp; “What the f*** that’s some absurd s***”.</p><p>He continued:&nbsp; “They’re brainwashed, really? Kidnapped, really? Can’t eat, really? Real talk, that s*** sound silly.”</p><p>At the beginning of the song, Kelly argued that he respected and represented the women who were allegedly trying to derail his career.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>He said: “I admit I done made some mistakes; And I have some imperfect ways.”</p><p>However, he ultimately accused his accusers of being “mad” because he had “some girlfriends”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000339680431-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000673598859-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000354229213-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/c4d806c4-a906-4b7c-8fb0-57cbdfff73bd.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>R Kelly sex abuse case - singer pleads not guilty to updated indictment</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hrZG6CeX%2BRaKlmo5Whubp5y7KpopujYsCmxIycrKWsXam%2Fqq3LaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fr-kelly-lyrics-sex-cult-trial.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fr-kelly-lyrics-sex-cult-trial.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fr-kelly-lyrics-sex-cult-trial.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fr-kelly-lyrics-sex-cult-trial.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fr-kelly-lyrics-sex-cult-trial.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fr-kelly-lyrics-sex-cult-trial.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./romeo-santos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./romeo-santos.html>Romeo Santos</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ne-yo-wife-crystal-renay-smith-accused-him-of-cheating-her.html>Ne-Yo Wife Crystal Renay Smith Accused Him Of Cheating Her</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ne-yo-wife-crystal-renay-smith-accused-him-of-cheating-her.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
