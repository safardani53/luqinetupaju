Luckily the stretchy supportive outfits I wear accentuate my bust really well, too.</p><p>My theory is that us women can naturally change the size of our breasts.</p><p>I used to do pole dancing twice a week.

The surgeon was encouraging me to go bigger, but I’m glad I stuck to my guns.</p><p>At first I hated them! I hadn't realised they'd swell during the first few days.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000455898568-e1544630661509.jpg><p>But once they settled down I began to appreciate the difference the implants made.</p><p>The volume gave me more shape and I started to enjoy how my chest looked in clothes.</p><p>During my early twenties I loved dressing to enhance them when I went out with my girlfriends.</p><p>When I turned 25 I realised that if I dressed a certain way men would just talk to my chest.&nbsp;I covered them up most days and especially when I was at work.</p><p>When I fell pregnant in my mid-twenties my breasts ballooned throughout each trimester going up a cup size every three months.&nbsp;By the time I was due to give birth they were massive - I went to a G.</p><p>Fortunately I went back to my E after giving birth to my daughter. While I did try to breastfeed, she wasn’t having any of it and refused to latch on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000454822997-e1544696576291.jpg><p>It's rare, but there is the odd day I’ll look at them in the mirror and wish they were smaller.</p><p>People are surprised and generally positive when they find out I have implants. They don’t look "stuck on" is a common thing I hear.</p><p>They do make me feel more confident in myself.&nbsp;While I’d like to lose a few extra pounds all over, I’m really happy with how I look today.</p><p>When I had them enlarged it was never about the physical aspect, it was about how I psychologically felt about my body.</p><p>Today my breasts are still quite perky and have survived having a child.&nbsp;A decade after having them done I do still like them and I don’t regret my decision.<br></p><h2>‘I hate my boobs - I’m saving to have them reduced’</h2><p><strong>Dancer and model Samantha Fisher, 27 lives in Kent with her boyfriend. Her boobs are REAL.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000454822019-e1544696614364.jpg><p>I’m a 32G and if I think back I can’t ever remember not having big boobs. I went to an all-girls school but my boobs started to grow before all my friends and didn’t seem to stop.</p><p>I hated them then and I hate them now.</p><p>After school I trained as a dancer and musical theatre performer, but I’ve spent years going to auditions with them bandaged up and strapped down.</p><p>Even if I did get the job often I’d lose it once I went for my fittings. They’d realise I had boobs and if I didn’t fit the costume, I’d be out. I’ve lost out on a lot of work because of them.</p><p>Ideally, I want to get them reduced to maybe a C or D but the NHS say my case isn’t strong enough, so I’d have to do it privately.</p><p>One doctor told me to lose weight. I’m already a size 10 and have never been big but I gave it a go and nothing changed.</p><p>I went back and told them it had no effect and they said my boobs weren’t big enough for the reduction and that the side-effects weren’t ‘bad enough’.</p><p>I’m now saving what I can to get the surgery done but it’s more expensive than getting a boob job because it’s higher risk. It would set me back about £6,000.</p><p>I know there’s a lot of scaring when it comes to having a boob reduction but I don’t care, as long as I had no boobs, I would be so happy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000454823475.jpg><p>I suffer from a bad back all the time, they are so heavy that my bra straps dig in and sometimes my bra has left cuts on my shoulders because of the weight.</p><p>What frustrates me the most is probably the clothes too, loads of fashion at the moment is delicate fabrics which are low cut and when you have no boobs it looks so classy but if I were to wear it, people would be just getting an eyeful and it looks tacky.</p><p>It’s one of the reasons why I have my hair so long too – to hide them.</p><p>My boyfriend loves them, of course he does, but it’s not like I can buy sexy bras. All my bras I have to get from either from M&S or House of Fraser and one bra would set me back £40, even if it’s just a gross nude one.</p><p>For people who go and pay to have their boobs done to be as big as mine I just want to say: don't.<br></p><h2>‘I love my small, perky boobs’</h2><p><strong>Interpreter Borina Vaughan, 32 has FAKE boobs and lives in North London with her two-year-old daughter Gerina.&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000454823895-e1544696759215.jpg><p>When I finished puberty in my mid-teens my breasts stayed at a 34AA and I was always very self-conscious of them.</p><p>At 5ft 2in I am short and today I’m a size 6-8.

But in an ideal world I wanted to fix what I saw as a problem area.</p><p>I never wanted massive glamour girl ones. I just wanted a small neat small pair of boobs that sat high and perky on my chest.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000455898535-e1544696801461.jpg><p>I got my 34A implants done in February 2015 and they cost £3,000.</p><p>When I fell pregnant eight months after I'd had them done they barely increased in size despite my three stone weight gain.</p><p>I breastfed my daughter for six months but within a year of giving birth they went back to their normal size.</p><p>I’m someone who only feels confident when her body is as perfect as possible so I worked hard to get my figure back in shape.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000454824576.jpg><p>My boobs are sexy but not OTT either -most people don’t realise I have fake boobs.&nbsp;If you say implants – people think enormous Playboy Mansion Bunny Girls.&nbsp;My chest is discreet and small.</p><p>They make me feel incredibly confident and feminine too. &nbsp;I feel like a real woman and that I belong. This small tweak to my body has made me really happy.</p><p>I love buying pretty lacy bras, cute bikinis and clothes that show them off.</p><p>I'm proof that you can find happiness with yourself and your body by going under the knife."<br></p><h2>‘I breastfed for two years and they never went back to how they were’</h2><p><strong>Actress and model Lucy Madgwick, 31, has REAL boobs and is mum to nine-year-old son Alfie.
