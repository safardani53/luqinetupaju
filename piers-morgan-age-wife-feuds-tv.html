That's on some Ashley Madison type s***."</p><p>One of Piers' long-standing and most public feuds is with billionaire businessman Lord Alan Sugar - and the two men frequently attack each other on Twitter.</p><p>Standing at just over six feet tall, Piers has a good few inches on his sparring partner Lord Sugar.</p><p>The TV presenter has also had many verbal tussles with GMB weather presenter Alex Beresford.</p><p>And he resigned from Good Morning Britain after walking off the set following an argument with the weatherman surrounding the Meghan Markle CBS interview in March 2021.</p><h2>What TV shows has Piers Morgan been on?</h2><p>Piers was the main host on Good Morning Britain between 2015 and 2021, where he often shared his opinions from Monday to Wednesday on ITV at 6am until 8.30am.</p><p>He also had stints as one of the judges on Britain's Got Talent&nbsp;and America's Got Talent where he helped to launch the careers of stars including Susan Boyle.</p><p>In 2018, he also appeared in Channel 4's Hollyoaks as himself.</p><p>Piers has also fronted a number of his own shows, including his Piers Morgan On... series and&nbsp;Piers Morgan's Life Stories.</p><p>He famously made friends with&nbsp;President Donald Trump&nbsp;after winning the US celebrity version of&nbsp;The Apprentice.</p><p>On January 25, 2018, it was revealed that&nbsp;Piers had interviewed the President for an exclusive ITV interview.</p><p>Piers also interviewed&nbsp;Lorenzo Gilyard&nbsp;as part of the&nbsp;Serial Killer With Piers Morgan&nbsp;programme on ITV.</p><p>On June 6, 2019, Piers appeared on Question Time and a primary school was caught out calling him a "fascist pig" on Twitter.</p><p>That same year, and after interviewing former US president Donald Trump, he went on to interview Cristiano Ronaldo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000579988399.jpg><h2>Has Piers Morgan interviewed Trump?</h2><p>Yes! - In a major coop for the journalist, Piers interviewed then President Donald Trump.</p><p>In an interview aired on GMB on May 5, 2019, Piers chatted with the President -&nbsp;all things from politics&nbsp;to Harry and&nbsp;Meghan, after she allegedly snubbed him.</p><p>In the wide-ranging interview, the US President:</p><ul><li>Insisted he&nbsp;never meant to insult Harry's wife when he criticised Meghan's "nasty" comments about him</li><li>Did a U-turn on the NHS - saying it would now NOT be on the table in trade deals</li><li>Revealed&nbsp;how he "listened" to Prince Charles&nbsp;on climate change and liked his passion for saving the planet</li><li>Praised the "great rapport" he had with the Queen and said they spoke for an hour and a half - but was tight lipped about the details</li><li>Said Ronald Reagan was his favourite President and Winston Churchill was a "hero"</li></ul><p>And to finish off the sit-down chat, Piers even gifted POTUS with his very own Churchill-style homburg hat.</p><h2>What's his relationship with Meghan Markle?</h2><p>Piers claimed the pair were friends back in 2016, recalling a time when he shared a couple of drinks with Meghan.</p><p>Piers said: "I had a couple of pints of real ale and she had dirty martinis.</p><p>"She said afterwards in the cab 'I had a great time. Love to see you again.' It was purely platonic I hasten to add.</p><p>"She went in that cab that night to a party Prince Harry was at and the next night she went on the date with him. I never heard from her again. Ever.</p><p>"I don't like people that behave like that. It's kind of rude. It showed me that she, I'm afraid, is probably a bit of social climber."</p><p>Piers added that he "got to know her quite well" over the two-year period, adding they "would message each other a lot, email a lot".</p><p>Unimpressed with the Duchess' treatment of him, he added: "Good luck to Harry. I hope he knows what he's doing.</p><p>"If it all goes wrong don't come try crying to me. Don't say I didn't warn you."</p><p>Piers has launched a series of attacks on the Duchess since the revelation they'd already met before.</p><p>His remarks led his departure from Good Morning Britain, after a row with Alex Beresford.</p><p>The TV presenter had remarked that he didn't "believe a word" Meghan Markle said during her interview with Oprah Winfrey on March 8.</p><p>In the interview, the Duchess of Sussex had revealed she had had suicidal thoughts during her time in the UK with the Royal Family.</p><p>Following his resignation, Piers reaffirmed what he had said on GMB, tweeting he still doesn't believe Meghan and "Freedom of speech is a hill I'm happy to die on".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000676702709-e1631804134540.jpg><h2>Who is Piers Morgan's wife?</h2><p>In 1991, Piers married Marion Shalloe, but they got divorced in 2008.</p><p>The former couple have three sons, named Spencer, Stanley and Albert, respectively aged 28, 24 and 20.</p><p>In 2010, Piers married Celia Walden, a feature writer and gossip columnist and the daughter of George Walden, the former Conservative MP.</p><p>She was also the last editor of The Daily Telegraph's now discontinued diary, Spy.</p><p>Celia gave birth to Piers' youngest child, daughter Elise, in 2011.</p><h2>What football team does Piers Morgan support?</h2><p>Piers is a huge fan of Arsenal</p><p>But he has also been an outspoken critic of the club.</p><p>He was very opinionated about Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger on social media and on the radio, and called for his sacking.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Celebrities including Piers Morgan and Vernon Kay arrive for the TRIC Awards 2021</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huZ2t%2Bd3%2BOqaCeqqNiurC%2BxpqlZpmXmnq4tcWeZJ%2BdpZnAbsDVaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpiers-morgan-age-wife-feuds-tv.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fpiers-morgan-age-wife-feuds-tv.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fpiers-morgan-age-wife-feuds-tv.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fpiers-morgan-age-wife-feuds-tv.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpiers-morgan-age-wife-feuds-tv.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpiers-morgan-age-wife-feuds-tv.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./deadly-bully-type-dogs-sale-online-without-checks.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./deadly-bully-type-dogs-sale-online-without-checks.html>Deadly bully-type dogs for sale online in UK - and ANYONE can buy them without checks</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./steven-wilson.html>Steven Wilson</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./steven-wilson.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
