Yang gushed about his father Richard Ouyang's transition from an ordinary person to an exceptionally confident actor on <a href=# rel=follow>Joe Rogan's</a>&nbsp;acclaimed podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Born in China,&nbsp;Ouyang spent most of his life away from the entertainment industry, working as a salesperson at Dow Chemical. He also founded a business of medical equipment and eventually sold it.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>After he moved to America with his family, he worked as a financial advisor. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As a person who lived his life doing decent jobs, Ouyang was against his son's decision to make a career as a stand-up.&nbsp;He even <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">suggested</a> Yang get a degree away from the arts and warned him he would be homeless&nbsp;if he pursued an&nbsp;art degree. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>So what exactly happened that he got into movies himself? Here's a quick rundown.&nbsp;</p><h2>Hard Time Impressing His Dad</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>While&nbsp;Yang has made himself known through his acting stints and humor on Crazy Rich Asians and multiple comedy shows, things weren't always sunshine and rainbows.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Following his parent's advice, he joined&nbsp;the University of California at San Diego and majored in Economics. But as soon as he started interning at a now-defunct financial-services company, Smith Barney, <a href=# rel=follow>the comedian</a> realized he couldn't stick with a 9-to-5 job.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Unable to pinpoint what he wanted to do in life, the Hong Kong native worked three jobs a day at one point. He worked as a sales agent during the day, a comedian at a comedy club in San Diego in the evening, and a strip club&nbsp;DJ at night.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Finally, the 34-year-old chose his passion and focused on comedy full-time. But his choice didn't impress his father. Nevertheless, his dad let him do what he wanted, hoping he would learn the truth&nbsp;even if it was through the hard way.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>For years,&nbsp;Yang struggled to get a decent hold on&nbsp;his career. He gave hundreds of&nbsp;auditions and only could book a few roles, leading him to a financial slump.&nbsp;</p><p>To cope with the situation,&nbsp;he bought a second-hand&nbsp;2006 Prius with the money he got from the first season of&nbsp;Silicon Valley and&nbsp;drove Uber. He continued the service until season two.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Eventually, things became a little easier for the budding actor as he became a regular cast for the series. And he thought his first significant milestone would impress his father.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>To his dismay, his father couldn't care less. Instead,&nbsp;Ouyang pointed that acting was an easy job and stated even he could do it.&nbsp;Thereon, things took an interesting turn.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Jimmy O. Yang's Father's Surprising Success</h2><p>Yang wanted his father to&nbsp;appreciate his years of hard work and prove to him that&nbsp;acting wasn't easy. So he introduced his father to his agent and signed him up for auditions.&nbsp;</p><p>In his own words, Yang had thought his father would finally understand the pressure of auditions and fear of rejection. His plan, however, backfired.&nbsp;</p><p>Surprisingly, his father did so well in the auditions that he would get six out of ten jobs. Ouyang even starred in a Chinese show that went viral and was successful in China.</p><p>Following that, he quickly impressed the casting crew of Space Force&nbsp;with his tapes and portrayed a Chinese scientist in the ninth episode.</p><p>Yang compared his first audition experience with his father's and shared that his confidence was extraordinary. He also mentioned that Ouyang was a talented person.&nbsp;</p><h2>How Richard Ouyang Joined ‘Patriots Day’</h2><p>Yang got to play a real-life Chinese person on&nbsp;Patriots Day, a movie that he wholeheartedly wanted&nbsp;to be authentic. The director had chosen a Chinese person with a Cantonese accent to be his&nbsp;father in the film.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>But Yang <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">wasn't thrilled</a> as the person's accent didn't match the criteria.&nbsp;</p><p>So he suggested the casting team hire his father, as his accent matched that from mainland China.&nbsp;</p><p>The acting crew approved and took in Ouyang to play Yang's on-screen father.&nbsp;</p><p>Other than Patriots Day,&nbsp;Ouyang has played in projects such as&nbsp;Buddy Solitaire&nbsp;and&nbsp;Lonely Blue Night.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKKZorq6ec5msJqml2KxorCMqZitqpmkwbR5w5qwZ6Ckork%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjimmy-o-yang-dad-patriots-day-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjimmy-o-yang-dad-patriots-day-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjimmy-o-yang-dad-patriots-day-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjimmy-o-yang-dad-patriots-day-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjimmy-o-yang-dad-patriots-day-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjimmy-o-yang-dad-patriots-day-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./in-n-out-fast-food-secret-menu-burgers.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./in-n-out-fast-food-secret-menu-burgers.html>People are just realizing two secret menu items at In-N-Out starting from $3 the after taste</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./zach-frank-drqs-html.html>Zach Frank (Painter) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./zach-frank-drqs-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
