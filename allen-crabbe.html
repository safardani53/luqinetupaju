Maintaining 84.3% from the Free-throw Line and being one of the top shooters, Crabbe was able to earn the first-team All-Pac-12 conferences again.</p><p><strong><a href=#>&lt;&lt;&lt;Tyus Jones: Career, Marriage & More>>></a></strong></p><p>With the final year making rounds along the corner, Crabbe ended this year with an average of 18.4 assists, 7 blocks, 1.1 steals, 2.6 assists, and 6.1 rebounds per game.</p><p>Adding to his outstanding performance in his junior year, he was voted Pac-12 Player of the Year and All-Pac-12 first-team third time in a row.</p><p>Another worthy mention was the national recognition by Sporting News and the National Association of Basketball.</p><h3>NBA Career</h3><p>Even if Crabbe was selected as the 31st overall pick by Cleaveland Cavaliers in 2014, he was already traded to the Portland Trail Blazers on draft night.</p><p>After a season with the Cavaliers, Idaho Stampede moved him in their wing for the NBA Development League, where he made 1 point and 5 rebounds in 37 minutes in a loss.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/One-cheer-for-Allen-Crabbe-two-for-the-team.jpg><p>Crabbe went back and forth with Blazers, finally debuting as a professional on November 11, 2014.</p><p>As a starter for the game, Allen played against Charlotte Hornets in a 102-100 win. That season he managed 2.2 points, 0.6 rebounds, and 0.4 assists for the team.</p><p>When Nets offered a four-year deal of $75 million to Crabbe in 2016, Blazers, not wanting to let go of Crabbe, decided to match the offer and re-sign him.</p><p>With the end of four seasons in Cleaveland, Allen joined the Blazers team and became the first guard to score 30 off the bench.</p><p>On his birthday, April 9, Crabbe gifted himself a career-high 41 points over Chicago Bulls on a 114-105 win, along with the highest 3-pointers made in the single season.</p><p>His highest for the 2018-19 season was 27 points in a 119-113 loss.</p><p>Crabbe played with Atlanta and Minnesota for further seasons, finally signing with Westchester Knicks in 2022.</p><h3>Playoffs&nbsp;</h3><p>Crabbe had played a total of 17 playoff contests for the Blazers.</p><p>He showed some of his best games, averaging 8.1 points, 2.8 rebounds, and 1.1 assists around the playoffs.</p><p><strong><a href=#>&lt;&lt;&lt;Luol Deng: Sudan, Injuries, Foundation & More>>></a></strong></p><h2>Injury</h2><p>Because of the sore right knee, Allen had to miss nine-straight contests and the other 26 games but soon returned to play against Denver Nuggets on Feb 6, 2019.</p><p>In 2018 Crabbe underwent successful right knee arthroscopy.</p><h2>Allen Crabbe | Net Worth&nbsp;</h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>It’s hard to depict a player’s net worth only based on his salary as they are involved in various campaigns and merch.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>So keeping that in mind and calculating all of his endeavors, salary, and career earnings, Crabbe’s net worth is around $20 million as of February 2022.</span></p><h3>Allen Crabbe $4.5 million House in LA</h3><p>Around January 2021, Allen was ecstatic to share a piece of good news with his fans.</p><p>Recently, he had bought a $4.5 million mansion on the grounds of Los Angeles, which sits in 0.37 acres of land.</p><p>The mansion was supposedly built in 2020 and had a $1.8 million tax value, and Crabbe has to pay $33 thousand for taxes each year.</p><p>It is three-storied in a 7,962 sq. ft with a relaxing atmosphere including sauna, movie room, half basketball court, pool house, swimming pool with spa, and others.</p><h2>Donations and Honors</h2><p>“As athletes, we make soo much money. But I won’t spend it in five cars and three houses.”</p><p>“It’s crazy, and it’s how people live, although we can’t even use all those pieces of stuff. I wonder when players say they are broke, like where could you blow all of that money because it’s too much money we make in our careers.”</p><p>Crabbe always believed in giving back to the people. So, when his former high school was on the brink of shutting down due to financial shortage, Crabbe offered a big help to them.</p><h3>Donation to Price</h3><p>It is well known that Allen graduated from his family school, Price.</p><p>After 2018-years graduated, Price was in heavy financial chaos. The school struggled and didn’t have enough donations to continue further.</p><p>When Crabbe found out about the school’s situation in a call with his mother, he offered a “mid-six figures” donation; Price continued their journey to the new year. All thanks to the shooting guard.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Skills-at-Price-High-with-Allen-Crabbe.jpg><p>His aunt, who runs the school, got very emotional over her nephew’s big heart and said, “I was very stunned. I cried for a month.”</p><p>Following the news of the donation, Crabbe mentioned that he and his family members all attended the school. “Ever since I was a kid, I remember going to Price until high school graduation.”</p><p>“Price is attached to my heart, and I did what I could at the moment.”</p><h3><span>A Little Bit of Back Story: Price High</span></h3><p>Allen’s grandfather, Apostle Frederick K.C Price, was a well-known televangelist who founded the Crenshaw Christian Center in 1973 and wrote faith-related books.</p><p>Having a good following from the church, his grandparents and aunt came up with the idea of a school.</p><p>So, the school first opened in September 1986. But unfortunately, with Allen’s eldest uncle dying in a car accident sometime later, the school decided to honor his name.</p><p>Mrs. Evans, Crabbe’s aunt, then named the school after her older brother, Frederick III.</p><p>However, Price has educated over 10000 students from pre-school to 12th grades in the Soth Angeles area.</p><p>And has 100 percent rates to 4-year-universities for its graduates with over 90 thousand scholarships.</p><p><strong><a href=#>&lt;&lt;&lt;Kevin Knox Bio: Career & Net Worth>>></a></strong></p><h3>Honors&nbsp;</h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Previously, he had helped the school by providing new computers, athletic equipment, and new uniforms.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Crabbe’s family, students, and teachers all made the school a place where children were free to pursue whatever they wanted in life, so Allen knew he had a responsibility toward them.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>And acknowledging Crabbe’s large donation, the school decided to honor the school’s basketball court in his name.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>On the day of his honor, he talked about being family with every person related to Price and said with a smile,” It’s going to continue to stay open.”</span></p><h2>Into Allen Crabbe’s Personal Life</h2><p>Crabbe was born under fire sign Aries to parents Allen Crabbe Jr. and Cheryl Price.</p><p>Nicole ‘Niki’ Kirkland is his older sister and his stylish. He once mentioned, “she’s like the mastermind behind all of my looks.”</p><p>Thanks to his sister, Allen attended a New York Fashion Week in 2019 where he got to meet other athletes, including <a href=#>Jimmy Butler</a>, Nick Young, and Victor Crus. Allen describes the experience as surreal.</p><p>Well, for Niki, she owns her boutique clothing store named “K.Ele ” on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Allen-Crabbe-with-his-family.jpg><p>His other sibling is his cutie brother Mari K, who just celebrated his 10th birthday in Colorado on 25 February 2019.
