Others find it difficult to understand them. When they lose their cool, it's like an explosion that scares people away.</p><p>People born on March 10 have a zodiac sign of <strong>Pisces</strong>.

Pisces is the zodiac's most perceptive, sensitive, and empathic sign, and that's because it's the last of the last. Pisces, as the final sign, has absorbed every lesson taught by the preceding signs, including the pleasures and sorrows, hopes and anxieties. It is represented as two fish swimming in opposite directions, symbolizing Pisces' continual divide of attention between imagination and reality.</p><p>Filipino actress who has had starring roles in many television series and won the Most Stylish Rising Star at the Candy Style Awards in 2013.
