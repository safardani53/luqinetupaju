But where is she now? And what happened after their divorce?&nbsp;</p><h2>Age & Body Measurements</h2><p>The famous former wife of The Undertaker, Jodi Lynn’s life, is more mysterious than her husband’s dramatic suspense.</p><p>Like her age, date of birth, and other essential information, most of her details are missing from the public.</p><p>However, she stands at 5 feet six inches (1.70 m) and weighs around 57 kg (125 pounds).&nbsp;</p><p>On top of that, she has an appealing personality and lovely qualities. From what exists on the internet, Jodi is a stunning woman both in appeal and character.</p><h2>Marriage & Children</h2><p>As we have stated, Jodi is the wrestler’s lawfully wedded first wife. They first met in the 80s and shortly after started dating.</p><p>The exact date and time are not mentioned, but they dated each other for a long time. The two tied the knot in 1989 in a confidential manner.</p><p>A year later, the newlyweds welcomed their first child, Gunner Vincent Calaway, in 1993. During this time, Undertaker’s career was also rising and saw significant growth as time passed.</p><p>The two were considered among WWE’s most famous and celebrated couples back then.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/jodi-004.jpg></p><p>So, you can imagine the shock when the two suddenly announced their divorce. Many could not believe the event was happening, but sadly, the famous couple parted ways in 1999.</p><p>From that day, The Undertaker has also refrained from talking about Jodi. This also includes the reason for their divorce.</p><p>Despite the secrecy, the two parted ways because of their different personalities.</p><h3>Is Jodi Lynn Calaway Single Now?</h3><p>Years after their split, it is said Jodi is still living a single life and has not tied the knot. However, the same can not be said about Calaway.</p><p>Mark married one of his WWE colleagues, <a href=# rel=noopener>Sara Cherie Frank</a>, a year after their split. Just like Undertaker, Sara was also a renowned name in WWE, and after their marriage, the two often appeared together.</p><p>Likewise, Sara then gave birth to two wonderful children, both daughters named Chasey, born in 2002, and Gracie, born in 2005.</p><p>But their marriage ended abruptly when things started to look up for the couple.</p><p>Just like his former marriage with Jodi, this ended. After seven years, Mark and Sara ended their marriage.</p><h3>The Undertaker & Michelle McCool</h3><p>The bravest thing one can do is fall in love again, even after a severe heartbreak.</p><p>We don’t know who broke the heart of whom, but The Undertaker has again fallen in love.</p><p>Yes, you heard that right! This eerily frightening man in the ring is a total romantic at heart. After his two unsuccessful marriages, Mark stayed single for two whole years.</p><p>In 2010, the famous wrestler married his girlfriend, Michelle McCool, and has been living blissfully with her.</p><p>Like in his past marriages, the two kept their wedding details secret and away from the public eye.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/253328258_276318041085650_941967496189155861_n.jpg></p><p>Mark and Michelle now have a daughter named Kaia Faith Calaway, born in 2012.</p><p>Talking about his current wife, Michelle, is also an American retired professional wrestler and has been a two-time WWE Divas Champion.</p><h2>Professional Career</h2><p>There is certainly not much for someone who got famous in the WWE universe when it comes to her life.</p><p>Jodi Lynn shared her fame with her husband’s rising career inside and outside the ring. However, we have no detailed information about Lynn’s career and professional activities.</p><p>Since The Undertaker started making a splash on the internet, she saw the changes happening in their lives slowly.</p><p>From commencing as a wrestler in the 80s to signing a million-dollar deal with the WWF with Vince McMahon, Jodi always supported Mark along the way.</p><p>Moreover, Jodi must have been genuinely grateful to Vince McMahon as she named her first child after him.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/jodi-001-1.jpg></p><p>Yes, she named her son, Gunner Vincent Calaway, as a tribute to WWE chairman Vince McMahon. Now an adult, Gunner graduated from Full Sail University as a video game artist.</p><p>As stated by the young man, he wants to be an artist for video games. He is currently a freelance artist and illustrator living in Nashville, Tennessee.</p><p>He has indicated that he is not interested in WWE or living life as a wrestler.</p><p>But don’t get it twisted; the father-son duo has a beautiful relationship.</p><h2>The Deadman ‘Undertaker’</h2><p>One of the prominent figures of the WWE franchise, <a href=# rel=noopener>The Undertaker</a>, whose real name happens to be <a href=# rel=noopener>Mark Calaway</a>, was born on March 24, 1965.</p><p>The Houston, Texas native is often regarded as the most outstanding wrestler of all time and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>The young Mark was born to his parents, Frank Compton Calaway and Betty Catherine Truby. Along with his parents, Undertaker grew up with four older brothers.</p><p>He attended Waltrip High School, where he played football and basketball as a teenager. After graduating in 1983, he joined Angelina College on a basketball scholarship.&nbsp;</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/123699777_429547361774906_1219547655409386589_n.jpg></p><p>Likewise, Calaway went to Texas Wesleyan University in 1985 in Fort Worth, Texas. There he studied sports management but dropped out in 1986 to focus on sports.&nbsp;</p><p>His official wrestling career started on June 26, 1984, when he fought for the World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) under the name “Texas Red.”</p><p>After his stint with WCCW, he joined the World Championship Wrestler (WCW) with the ring name “Mean Mark” Callous in 1989 and stayed there for 11 years.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, in October 1990, he signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and debuted as the Undertaker. This is where he truly thrived as a wrestler and as an entertainer.</p><h2>How Much Is The Net Worth Of Jodi Lynn?&nbsp;</h2><p>Just like her professional career, there are no details regarding her net worth and income. The first wife of ‘The Undertaker’ has kept all her information private.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, her former husband has a net worth of <strong>$17 million </strong>as of 2023.</p><p>He has been a professional wrestler since his debut in 1984 and an active member of the WWE since 1990 until he retired in 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>He is a four-time WWF/E Champion, three-time World Heavyweight Champion, six-time WWF World Tag Team Champion, one-time WCW Tag Team Champion, and WWF Hardcore Champion.</p><p>According to the stats, the now-retired wrestler wrestled in 172 matches. All of his income comes from his profession as a wrestler, in addition to his wins.</p><p>It is not confirmed, but the rumor is that Mark earns an annual income of $2.5 million from WWE.&nbsp;</p><p>Sadly, his other information regarding his houses, cars, and other lavish expenses is not included in the public details.</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p>As expected from someone as introverted as Jodi, she has isolated herself from the celebrity world.</p><p>There is no existence of hers on social media or anything remotely related to it. Even after an intense and detailed search, we couldn’t find any traces of her on the social network.&nbsp;</p><h3>The Undertaker Is Also New To Instagram</h3><p>During his time in WWE, Mark created an eerie vibe unmatched by any of his future predecessors. Not to mention, he had maintained the same level of secrecy outside the ring as well.</p><p>In 2018, the WWE superstar officially joined Instagram under Undertaker and posted a photo to verify the account. At the moment, Calaway has over 4.4&nbsp;million followers and about 140 posts.</p><p>Likewise, Calaway’s Instagram posts are filled with his WWE moments, family gatherings, and other insights into his personal life. We are sure to get more updates on his life in the future.</p><p><strong>Instagram:</strong> 4.4M Followers</p><p><strong>Twitter:</strong> 512.4K Followers</p><h2>Popularity Graph&nbsp;</h2><p>Even without social media and newer fan interaction, Jodi Lynn is stillfamousr online.
