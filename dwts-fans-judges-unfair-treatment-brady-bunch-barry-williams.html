He is actually doing really good and got some great movement. Those scores are wrong," one commenter wrote.</p><p>Another posted: "I'm sorry, Barry ate that dance!. He was WAY better than stiff Adrian, stiff Mira and stiff Tyson!! Why are the judges being so critical on him and not the others?! Favoritism is a huge reason why I don't like this show."</p><p>"They're trying to get Barry out of here cause he did so good!! To me he is what this show is about," a third user wrote.</p><p>Someone else wrote: "Carrie Ann no one cares about your opinions especially when you very clearly choose favorites every season."</p><p>Another reacted: "Why is Barry actually good? I hate that I assumed he would be awful. He's obviously not the best dancer on the show but I would must rather watch him improve every week than be struck watching [<a href=#>Jamie Lynn Spears</a>] and Adrian."</p><h2><strong>TOO PREDICTABLE?</strong></h2><p>DWTS viewers have long felt that the judges show favoritism on the show.</p><p>During the <a href=#>premiere</a>, which aired on September 26, fans predicted a breakout winner.</p><p>Jason Mraz has been <a href=#>projected as the winner</a> of season 32 of the dancing competition series after he performed a near-perfect cha-cha with his partner Daniella Karagach in the first episode.</p><p>They performed to the song I Feel Like Dancing and were given sevens by the trio of judges.</p><p>Bruno called Jason "a dancer," while Carrie Ann declared that it was "the best dance of the night."</p><p>Jason left the first show in second place with only <a href=#>Ariana Madix</a> in front of him.</p><p>The two-time Grammy winner claimed in a pre-recorded segment that he has "faked his way through dancing" for the majority of his career."</p><p>He said at the time: "In college, I studied musical theater, but then one day I got to the door of the dance studio and said, ‘I’m not going back in there.</p><p>"I knew what was in that room — humiliation. Because the students had a lot more experience than me and I’d see all my weaknesses.</p><p>“I just went and focused where I could focus and sing immediately, which was like busking on the sidewalk and playing in coffee shops."</p><p>He went on: "Since then, I’ve hid behind a guitar, but a part of me still wants to go through that door.”</p><p>Fans on X speculated that he'll be crowned the winner when all is said and done.</p><p>One wrote at the time: "I'm calling it now, Jason Mraz&nbsp;with the win! He can dance and he will win everyone over with his personality!"</p><h2><strong>SO OVER IT</strong></h2><p>DWTS fans have repeatedly claimed the show is unfair and week one was no different.</p><p>In addition to pointing to a possible front-runner, viewers slammed the judges for giving cast member Jamie Lynn <a href=#>a high score</a> despite her "rough" dancing.</p><p>The former Nickelodeon star danced with her partner Alan Bersten for a tango routine.</p><p>They struggled throughout the dance but were given an overall score of 15 out of 30 at the time.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Viewers claimed the score was a bit too generous for the routine that was performed.</p><p>One person wrote on X: "I don't care how bad anyone is tonight priority number 1 is getting <a href=#>Jamie Lynn Spears gone</a>! Love you Alan but she's gotta go."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/dwts-fans-furiously-accuse-judges-849880005.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/dwts-fans-furiously-accuse-judges-849880003.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/dwts-fans-furiously-accuse-judges-849880004.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxYmmBdoCWaJuwrKNis6K60mahrpyXmsBuwc2fmKKqXam%2Fpq3TppynrF2Xv6Kw2GaZrqaTnXqjrdGrsGavmaG5qq3MrGY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdwts-fans-judges-unfair-treatment-brady-bunch-barry-williams.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdwts-fans-judges-unfair-treatment-brady-bunch-barry-williams.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdwts-fans-judges-unfair-treatment-brady-bunch-barry-williams.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdwts-fans-judges-unfair-treatment-brady-bunch-barry-williams.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdwts-fans-judges-unfair-treatment-brady-bunch-barry-williams.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdwts-fans-judges-unfair-treatment-brady-bunch-barry-williams.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./zahng-gil-jah.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./zahng-gil-jah.html>Fame | Zahng Gil-jah net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./dean-unglert-gives-caelynn-miller-keyes-4th-engagement-ring-pic.html>Dean Unglert Gives Caelynn Miller-Keyes 4th Engagement Ring: Pic</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./dean-unglert-gives-caelynn-miller-keyes-4th-engagement-ring-pic.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
