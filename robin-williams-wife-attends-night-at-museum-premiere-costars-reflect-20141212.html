<time>16 Mar 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Robin Williams</strong> was remembered by his friends and loved ones at the Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb film premiere in NYC on Thursday, Dec. 11. <a href=#>His widow, <strong>Susan Schneider</strong></a>, was also in attendance to celebrate the star’s final role. She looked relaxed and smiled while walking the red carpet.</p><p>Williams played Teddy Roosevelt in the adventure comedy franchise, appearing in Night at the Museum (2006), Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian (2009) and the third movie before his tragic death back in August. Find out what Ben Stiller, Ricky Gervais, and more had to say about their late costar below.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Ben Stiller</strong></a> (Larry Daley): “I honestly felt fortunate every day that I got to work with him because I was such a fan of his as a kid. I never really got over being starstruck by him…so for me just any day I got to work with him was exciting. The thing that comes through in his work is who I felt he was as a person, the little that I knew him is this genuine warmth, this genuine sense of caring for other people that is a part of what you see anytime you see him on film.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><strong>Ricky Gervais</strong> (Dr. McPhee): “Everything was a good memory about him. He was lovely from first thing in the morning till the last thing at night. He just tried to make you feel better however he was feeling. I did a charity gig with him once and he was the big star and he stayed by the stage while all the other acts were on and watched them and said something when they came off. Just a lovely generous man, I loved him.”</p><p><strong>Dan Stevens</strong> (Sir Lancelot): “He is such an amazing man to get to watch work, but also watching how generous and supportive he was and encouraging he was of anybody who was trying to make a joke really. He just loved laughter.”</p><p><strong>Steve Coogan</strong> (Octavius): “I had a great night with him up in Canada a few years ago where he was just dancing with everyone and having a real ball. He was just unpretentious, down to earth and a lot of fun. Just someone whose heart was always in the right place. There was nothing cynical about him, he was always trying to be positive in his company.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>Rami Malek</strong> (Ahkmenrah): “That man was incredibly genuine and humble and caring. He gave everyone attention no matter what their position was on the job. He had an immense amount of class and dignity, and it wasn’t anything that was put on, it was just inherent. He really was an incredible human being.”&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Mizuo Peck</strong> (Sacajawea): “I was just so honored to have worked with Robin over these three movies, and he is always going to be my Teddy — we were boyfriend and girlfriend [in the film].”</p><p>The Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb hits theaters on Friday, Dec. 19.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarp5Keu27DyKWjopmdqHq4tcWeZJqspJq7pb%2BMp6CgoKRirrV5zK6qnq2dYr2zscyinKudXZi8tMDAq6pmqpWbuaav02ZpaWlkZn9yfo4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frobin-williams-wife-attends-night-at-museum-premiere-costars-reflect-20141212.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frobin-williams-wife-attends-night-at-museum-premiere-costars-reflect-20141212.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frobin-williams-wife-attends-night-at-museum-premiere-costars-reflect-20141212.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frobin-williams-wife-attends-night-at-museum-premiere-costars-reflect-20141212.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frobin-williams-wife-attends-night-at-museum-premiere-costars-reflect-20141212.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frobin-williams-wife-attends-night-at-museum-premiere-costars-reflect-20141212.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lipoedema-5-symptoms-love-island-shaughna-phillips-diagnosis.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lipoedema-5-symptoms-love-island-shaughna-phillips-diagnosis.html>What is lipoedema?
