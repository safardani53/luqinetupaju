<time>23 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Throughout his career, comedian Pete Holmes has worked on dozens of movies and TV series. Among all of his works, he is best known for starring in Crashing (2017-2019), which he also wrote and produced. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Crashing <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>is a semi-autobiographical show that revolves around a fictional version of Holmesâ€”the first season aired on the HBO network from February 19, 2017, to April 9, 2017.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The second and third seasons aired in 2018 and 2019, respectively. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>'Crashing' Is based on Pete Holmes' Divorce from His Wife</h2><p>During its three-year&nbsp;run, Crashing enjoyed great success and received much love from viewers. Some of it had partly to do with Holmes sharing his personal story through the show. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>The series is loosely based on Holmes' real divorce from his wife while he was trying to make himself known in the <a href=# rel=follow>comedic space</a>.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Holmes, who grew up religious, married the first girl that he dated after he graduated. But, unfortunately, their marriage did not work out, and she left him when he was 28. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Pete Holmes and his on-screen wife in 'Crashing'</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">YouTube</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Holmes has since described the process of making the show as being therapeutic, especially since it helped him come to terms with his divorce from his wife. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>When <a href=# rel="follow noopener">talking to Inverse</a>, the comedian also noted that the show was really about two affairs and three breakups.</p><p>"[My character] is having an affair with comedy while she [his wife] is having an affair with another person," he said. "And then he breaks up with his wife and then his parents."</p><p>"And then he starts to break up, not with God, but with what his original understanding of God is. So it's really like, he's getting kind of confronted on three very big levels." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Much of what the show portrays is grounded on his real-life experiences following his split from his spouse.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Holmes also shared that watching his character was interesting because it allowed him to narrow down his own experience and see how his authenticity and actual life experiences were infused into his comedy.</p><h2>Pete Holmes & Wife</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Though his ex-partner is a huge part of Crashing, Holmes has revealed very little about her. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">told Business Insider</a> that while his fictional character's ex is based on his own, he changed many things about them. While the gist of the situation remains the same, Holmes revealed he had reframed and reworded many conversations and incidents.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Holmes revealed he hadn't notified his ex that he was making a show about their split.</p><p>"My ex and I haven't spoken since we split, which was almost 10 years ago. She's off and happy and I'm off and happy. The reaching out, there wasn't really one," he said.</p><p>In a separate <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">conversation with USA Today</a>, Holmes noted his friends had told him to make a show based on his divorce way earlier. However, he had declined because he didn't do personal comedy at the time. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In hindsight, it turned out to be an excellent decision because it allowed him to "digest what happened and gain perspective" on matters regarding his and his ex's split.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Holmes shared it was important to him as it allowed him to represent both sides of a break up.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He also acknowledged that had he made Crashing a few years earlier, it would have been bitter and he would have most likely portrayed his ex-spouse as some sort of villain. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKiVqbJutM6lpJ6rXay2p7GNoaumpA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpete-holmes-wife-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fpete-holmes-wife-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fpete-holmes-wife-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fpete-holmes-wife-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpete-holmes-wife-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpete-holmes-wife-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kanye-west-co-writer-rhymefest-quits-says-rapper-needs-spiritual-mental-help-w164307.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kanye-west-co-writer-rhymefest-quits-says-rapper-needs-spiritual-mental-help-w164307.html>Kanye West Cowriter Rhymefest Quits, Says Rapper Needs Spiritual, Mental Help</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sparky-lyle.html>Sparky Lyle</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sparky-lyle.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
