<time>04 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>WHEN Caroline and Neil Gale first set eyes on the caravan they'd just purchased for </strong>£100 off Ebay, they were greeted by a crumbling and neglected mobile home.</p><p>Not only did it leak but the inside was dingy and dark, and for years only mice had dared to live in it - however that didn't deter the determined couple.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

lost-cause caravan into their dream boutique 'hotel on wheels', using products predominantly from <a href=#>Asda</a>, <a href=#>B&M</a>, <a href=#>Home Bargains</a> and <a href=#>Ikea</a>.</p><p>Caroline says: "It was quite old fashioned and dark, and I prefer simple, neutral decor so we painted, refurbed the kitchen, and installed new lights - making it minimalist but functional."</p><p>Now, it's actually become somewhat of a hobby for <a href=#>Sainsbury's</a> delivery driver Neil, 59, and retired Caroline, 58, who have four children, and live just outside Leeds, North Yorkshire.</p><p>After their impressive caravan redesign, the couple have now turned a builder's van into a fully-functioning off-grid automobile, and are always on the look out for new projects.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON HOLIDAY HOMES">READ MORE ON HOLIDAY HOMES</h2><img

life</h2><p>The couple, who've been married for 20 years, first got the bug for caravan life just before lockdown, and have owned three caravans in total since, renovating each to varying degrees.</p><p>Caroline says: "Before, it was not something we'd ever really thought about and we'd always holiday abroad, three or four times a year and loved it.</p><p>"Then lockdown and all the restrictions came, and we needed to get out and do something when we could.</p><p>"The first one we purchased didn't need much work, and we just restyled it really."</p><p><h2

src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/thegoodlifevan-802355388.jpg><h2>£300 transformation</h2><p>The third, which they named Molly, was their biggest caravan renovation job, purchased from Ebay in May 2021 for £100.</p><p>They spent approximately £300 giving it a makeover.</p><p>Caroline says: "It was unloved and damp, and there were holes in the roof and everything so took quite a bit of work.</p><p>"The previous owner had lost the passion for it so it had been in storage for some time and it had mice, so we had to rip everything out."</p><p>Neil adds: "Caroline does all the decor, and designed it how she wanted it, including the neutral colour scheme.</p><p>"Caravans often have dark pre-built cupboards, which are lovely, but we wanted to do something a bit different to give it that light and airy feel."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ad66819b-c12d-4203-902c-a77933f29cf6.jpg> <img

on a shoestring budget</h2><p>To create a luxury feel, Caroline knew she didn't need to spend a fortune, and relied on high street stores to kit the place out.</p><p>She says: "We got a few bits from B&M bargains, like the plants, and the cushion covers were H&M and Ikea.</p><p>"I bought some vases from charity shops for 50p, and I up-cycled and painted them, and the bamboo bathroom mirror was £8 from Asda.</p><p>"That style of mirror was really popular at the time but were really expensive in most places, and this one just looks the same!</p><p>"I also up-cycled an Ikea spice rack into a bathroom shelf."</p><p>Neil adds: "The sink in the bathroom is actually a fruit bowl from Ikea, and I basically drilled a hole and put a plug hole in the bottom."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/thegoodlifevan-802355409.jpg> <img

project</h2><p>The couple recently passed Molly on to their friends, but the caravan is still stored on their property.</p><p>Now, their latest project has been even more ambitious, transforming a builder's van, named Petra the Peugeot.</p><p>They bought Petra in June 2021 for £9k into a fully functioning holiday home, and they go away every week for two days when Neil's off work, exploring Yorkshire predominantly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/d379f90e-b009-47ec-98ce-2de306df3ffe.jpg> <img

everything, including installing running water, gas, solar panels and furniture as well decorating has cost the couple an additional £3.5k - which is cheap by normal standards.</p><p>Neil says: "We decided we'd like to travel to places that you can't get to in a caravan, by the beach or down narrow lanes and we can go completely off grid.</p><p>"We decided to do the van up in the same style as the caravan, with a lot of products again from places like B&M and Ikea.</p><p>"The rug is actually £8 from Home Bargains, so really cheap and has lasted.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"We're still on the look out for small caravans we can do up too - it's a real passion we have and the satisfaction of doing a good job and getting comments on social media - it's so rewarding."</p><p>Caroline adds: "We can't do it right now but we will definitely spend more time in the van in the future, and want to go away travelling abroad for months at a time."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
