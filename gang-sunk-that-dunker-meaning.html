But what's the meaning of her comment, "gang sunk that dunker"?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty</span></figure><p>Amalaratna Zandile Dlamini, aka <a href=#>Doja Cat</a>, isn't really known for keeping her opinion to herself. And her fans are outspoken about loving her for it. So when her fans caught a post made by <a href=#>Lana Del Rey</a> on May 21 in which Doja was mentioned, they weren't particularly happy. Neither were the fans of any of the other female artists that Lana named.&nbsp;</p><p>Neither, apparently, was Doja herself.&nbsp;</p><p>In a now-deleted comment, Doja wrote, "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gang sunk that dunker</a>." Sounds negative for sure, but, um, what the heck does it mean?</p><p>It turns out that it isn't the first time Doja has alluded to the phrase. And where she said it last has some painfully bad context.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What's the meaning behind "gang sunk that dunker" and why did Doja write it?</h2><p>On May 21, Lana took to Instagram to write what would become a controversial post, the full text of which can be seen below:</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: instagram</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: instagram</a></figure><p>Lana opens the post by saying, "Now that Doja Cat, Ariana, Camila, Cardi B, Kehlani and Nicki Minaj and Beyonc√© have number one songs about being sexy, wearing no clothes, f--king, cheating etc ‚Äî can I please go back to singing about being embodied, feeling beautiful by being in love even if the relationship is not perfect, or dancing for money ‚Äî or whatever I want ‚Äî without being crucified or saying I'm glamorizing abuse?"</p><p>Lana goes on to say that she's tired of being told that she's "set women back hundreds of years" and that she believes "there needs to be a place in feminism for women who look and act like me." She also stated that she "really paved the way for women to stop 'putting on a happy face' and just say whatever the hell they wanted in their music."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Many took offense at Lana's post.</h2><p>Overwhelmingly, the fans of the women listed at the top of Lana's post were not thrilled that she'd included them and a general consensus was that she was suggesting that she'd "paved the way" for the artists listed. And anyone could tell you that, if you come for Beyonc√©, the Beyhive will sting. It was also not lost on many people that she primarily listed women of color, which some took to be a racist sentiment.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Beyonc√©: If you don't jump to put jeans on, Baby, you don't feel my pain<br>Lana del rey: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/AmnQxjTxCH</a></p>‚Äî Leela‚Å∑ *ÔΩ•Ôæü‚úß (@monoyonce) <a href=#>May 21, 2020</a></figure><p>Many memes were made essentially accusing Lana of throwing a tantrum that the women listed were more successful than her, though they sing about similar topics.</p><p>It seemed that Doja herself took some offense. She commented, "gang sunk that dunker," before deleting it, though, as we already know, if you put it on the internet, it lives forever. The problem is, though, no one seems to know what she actually meant.&nbsp;</p><p>While some believe that the statement means "points were made," most believe it's a negative, with the general understanding of it being that Lana is "that dunker" as she tried to shoot her shot with the post. But the gang (Doja's fan / the fans of all the other women listed) sunk her, or dragged her for what she said.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>What does this mean can someone explain to me? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ml0Pi51AeW</a></p>‚Äî DEADDILF üêÅ (@deaddilf69) <a href=#>May 21, 2020</a></figure><p>Though the comment was deleted off the post, it's unknown if Doja or Lana did the deleting. However, Doja later tweet, "Gang ______________. (Complete it)," which seems to suggest that she stands by what she said...even if no one is totally sure what she means by it.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Lana further clarified what she meant in the comments section of her post.</h2><p>The backlash to the initial post was so strong, Lana jumped into the comments of her post several times to explain what she meant.&nbsp;</p><p>"To be clear because I knowwwwww you love to twist things. I f--king love these singers and know them. #that is why I mentioned them I would also like to have some of the same freedom of expression without judgment of hysteria. There you go [sic]," her first comment read.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty</span></figure><p>She followed up with, "By the way the singers I mentioned are my favorite singers so if you want to try and make a bone to pick out of that like you always do be my guest, it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that I haven‚Äôt had the same opportunity to express what I wanted to express without being completely decimated and if you want to say that that has something to do with race that‚Äôs your opinion but that‚Äôs not what I was saying."</p><p>"Bro," she continued. "This is sad to make it about a WOC issue when I‚Äôm talking about my favorite singers. I could‚Äôve literally said anyone but I picked my favorite f--king people. And this is the problem with society today, not everything is about whatever you want it to be. It‚Äôs exactly the point of my post ‚Äì there are certain women that culture doesn‚Äôt want to have a voice it may not have to do with race I don‚Äôt know what it has to do with. I don‚Äôt care anymore but don‚Äôt ever ever ever ever bro- call me racist because that is bulls--t."</p><p>She concluded with, "And my last and final note on everything ‚Äì when I said people who look like me ‚Äì I meant the people who don‚Äôt look strong or necessarily smart, or like they‚Äôre in control etc. it‚Äôs about advocating for a more delicate personality, not for white woman ‚Äì thanks for the Karen comments tho. V helpful."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">But on May 22, it was Doja's turn to get canceled due to very racist receipts.</h2><p>On May 22, #DojaCatIsOverParty began trending ‚Äî thanks to some rather painful videos.&nbsp;</p><p>"I learned that if you sunk a dunker, you could be anybody," she said, in the chat that is reportedly known as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tea Time</a>. The Tinychat room is known to be a home for incels and racists. The video evidence of Doja engaging with the group is damaging enough, but it also shows her being open about her preference for white men.&nbsp;</p><p>There are further claims that she has reportedly said anti-black statements, used racial slurs, claimed to not want to be black, and put on sexually explicit shows for the men in Tea Time. As of now, these reports cannot be corroborated with video evidence, but there are some who claim that that they have seen it firsthand.&nbsp;</p><p>Another further issue was the report that Doja's song "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dindu Nuffin</a>" was about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sandra Bland</a>, who was found hanged in her jail cell three days after her arrest at a traffic stop. Video evidence was released of police brutality during her arrest. The phrase "dindu nuffin" is reportedly used to mock black people who died in police brutality.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnK6vs4ysrKejXam1osCMnayno5Wneq6xwKegp58%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgang-sunk-that-dunker-meaning.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgang-sunk-that-dunker-meaning.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgang-sunk-that-dunker-meaning.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgang-sunk-that-dunker-meaning.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgang-sunk-that-dunker-meaning.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgang-sunk-that-dunker-meaning.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-much-is-jimmie-walker-net-worth-in-2020-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-much-is-jimmie-walker-net-worth-in-2020-html.html>How Much Is Jimmie Walker Net Worth In 2020?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./bradley-cooper-and-lady-gaga-reunite-at-maestro-premiere.html>Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga Reunite at the Maestro Premiere Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./bradley-cooper-and-lady-gaga-reunite-at-maestro-premiere.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
