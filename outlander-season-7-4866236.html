Not only will she go to trial, but she’s seen being fitted for a noose in the season 7 teaser. “I had a dream, there was light all around you,” Jamie tells Claire in a sweet voiceover. “It wasn’t a candlelight or a firelight. And I thought, ‘Now, that must be what electric light is like.'” Claire then replies, “But how can you recognize something you’ve never seen in real life?”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Jamie adds, “I dream of the past, why would I not dream of the future?” Will Claire and Jamie travel to present day together?
