They were black, matte lace-up boots that seemed to make every outfit feel cooler, and as soon as I put them on for the first time, I knew I had found a go-to option for accessorizing any and every look. Dress? Pair it with Dr. Martens. Winter gear? Pair it with Dr. Martens. Skirt and top? You guessed it: Dr. Martens. I’m certainly not alone in feeling this way, either. Created more than 50 years ago,<strong> </strong>the<strong> </strong>Dr. Martens brand has created some of the most recognizable and iconic shoes in the world.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Head of Product/Merchandising Kristin Jones tells PEOPLE that the very first pair of Dr. Martens shoes were created on April 1, 1960. “With its trademark yellow stitch, grooved sole and heel-loop, it was a boot for workers, initially worn by postmen and policemen; comfortable, durable and lightweight in comparison to its competitors at the time,” Jones says, explaining that though the boots were initially designed with factory workers in mind, they soon became popular with “punks, musicians, and anyone who stood for self-expression.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Throughout Dr. Martens history, the brand has been adopted and subverted by diverse individuals, musicians, youth cultures and tribes,” she says. “These are the people who stand out from the crowd and their journey of self-expression has always been accompanied by a pair of DMs.” Dr. Martens aren’t just for musicians or artists, though. They’re for anyone and everyone in between.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking to add your very first pair of Docs to your wardrobe, here are 10 of the most popular Dr. Martens shoes and some information on what exactly makes them great.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dr-martens-1460-smooth-leather-lace-up-boots></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dr. Martens 1460 Smooth Leather Lace-Up Boots</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dr. Martens 1460 Lace-Up Boots " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/JWCTCstt6ZBf6qv8fNcaGQ3HD5Y=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dr-martens-1460-lace-up-boots-43598248eaee4a6eba9246a70eacc7a2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dr. Martens</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>They require a bit of breaking in, so if you're not willing to spend some time stretching them out, then you might want to choose another shoe</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If there is a most iconic pair of Dr. Martens boots, it’s these: The classic 1460, which is the brand’s original style. When the first Dr. Martens were created, they looked nearly identical to this traditional lace-up boot. This smooth leather version of the boot is available in eight different colorways this season and can be polished for a shinier coat or worn-in and scuffed up for a more casual look. The brand describes them as “famously stiff to start,” which echoes the one thing everyone should know about Dr. Martens boots: They require a bit of breaking in. However, once they are broken in, they’re incredibly durable, comfortable, and will last you decades. It's recommended to size down since they do run a bit large.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> 5-12 US Women's, 6-14 US Men's | <strong>Construction:</strong> Smooth leather upper, Goodyear welt construction, textile lining, cushioned footbed, rubber outsole | <strong>Colors: </strong>Black, Cherry Red, White, Green, Navy, Pink, Burgundy, Hot Pink</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dr-martens-smooth-leather-chelsea-boots></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dr. Martens Smooth Leather Chelsea Boots</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Dr. Martens 2976 Smooth Leather Chelsea Boots" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Loa4qtN_nq4LcmI6JRpT6qAl1aw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dr-martens-2976-smooth-leather-chelsea-boots-3d889ecd77f140d9882b6fe71514e9af.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re more interested in a pair of boots that you can slip on, but you still want a classic pair of Docs, these are going to be for you. Like the 1460s, there are a few different versions of these (including the faux fur-lined pair that we’ll talk about next), but these smooth leather boots are incredibly versatile. Available in both white and black leather, these are a classic Chelsea boot silhouette and have been around since the ‘70s. Like the 1460s, these take a bit to wear in as well, but the elasticized sides may make the process a bit more comfortable. In fact, many positive reviews note these as even more comfortable than the classic, lace-up styles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>5-11 US Women's (runs large) | <strong>Construction: </strong>Smooth leather upper, air-cushioned sole, elastic gussets, Goodyear welt construction | <strong>Colors: </strong>Black, White, Cherry Red, Burgundy</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dr-martens-2976-chelsea-boots-with-faux-fur></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dr. Martens Chelsea Boots With Faux Fur</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dr. Martens 2976 Chelsea Boots With Faux Fur" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/V7WldlfY_vm2VZK7siwzFPrxmfo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dr-martens-2976-chelsea-boots-with-faux-fur-5c16d30b70dd4e37814730babd4d155e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dr. Martens</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you enjoy following fashion influencers on Instagram and TikTok, you might have seen these in a post or two over the fall and winter holidays. They’re a super cute, of course, but also incredibly practical for colder temperatures, thanks to the extra cozy faux fur lining. Almost all the reviews note just how cozy these shoes are, making them an acceptable replacement for your casual, worn-in slipper boots when you need to look more polished.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>5-11 US Women's (runs large) | <strong>Construction: </strong>Smooth leather upper, air-cushioned sole, elastic gussets, Goodyear welt construction, faux fur lining | <strong>Colors: </strong>Black</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dr-martens-jadon-8-eye-leather-platform-boot></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dr. Martens Jadon 8-eye Leather Platform Boot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/_-lYc2SuXo4SrJ7vqV0tY4mHQoE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dr-martens-jadon-smooth-leather-platform-boots-30b6d6718fca4a25a87c0c72ff67030a.jpg"><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Platform boots are another popular iteration of Dr. Martens, and the style is arguably more popular than ever. Though the Jadon boot has only been part of Dr. Martens since 2013, Jones noted that it’s now one of Dr. Martens best-selling styles. This particular pair comes in white and black options, and features a 1.5-inch platform, so it makes a statement without any discomfort. These are also made of a more pliable leather than some more traditional pairs of Docs, which some reviewers made them extra comfortable and eliminated the dreaded breaking-in period.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>5-12 US Women's (runs large) | <strong>Construction: </strong>Polished smooth leather upper, PVC outsole, Goodyear welt construction, 2-inch heel | <strong>Colors: </strong>Black, White</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dr-martens-rometty-leather-chelsea-boots></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dr. Martens Rometty Leather Chelsea Boots</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Rometty Leather Chelsea Boots" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/GjuF2cP97OFqcCW2WQwshVUVBF4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dr-martens-rometty-leather-chelsea-boots-74cb2831741247d691ca55e2f503fc86.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dr. Martens</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For those searching for a pair of Dr. Martens when a slightly more feminine feel, consider these Rometty Chelsea Boots which feature a stacked chunky heel. These are another style that are highly rated with many reviews specifically mentioning their comfort and all-day wearability — perfect if you love the Chelsea boot style but want a bit more lift. The 2.25-inch heel does just that, offering height for when you want to dress up your jeans and T-shirt or pair with floral dresses year-round.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>5-11 US Women's (runs large) | <strong>Construction: </strong>Rugged leather upper, air-cushioned sole, elastic gussets, 2.25-inch heel height | <strong>Colors: </strong>Brick, Black</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dr-martens-1461-bex-smooth-leather-oxford-shoes></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dr. Martens 1461 Oxfords</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="1461 Oxfords" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/vTPS7ma8KoL4W-B0XHhrnmJNJXg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dr-martens-1461-oxfords-51760649c7264553a98b693ffa3747e3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dr. Martens</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although not boots, Jones named these 1461 Oxfords as quintessential Dr. Martens and one of the most popular styles of the brand. Like the 1460s, these oxfords have a lace-up design and the stiff, takes-time-to-wear-in leather that Dr. Martens is known for. This style is unisex, so is offered in both men's and women's shoe sizes — although, like most Docs, they do run large, so we suggest sizing down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>5-11 US Women's, 6-14 Men's | <strong>Construction: </strong>Smooth leather upper, air-cushioned sole, elastic gussets, 1-inch platform height, Goodyear-welted stitching | <strong>Colors: </strong>Black, White, Khaki</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dr-martens-leona-vintage-smooth-leather-heeled-boots></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dr. Martens Leather Heeled Boots</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=950 data-sizes=750px alt="Dr. Martens Leona Women's Vintage Smooth Leather Heeled Boots" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/wtAvYMEFTOgf2nKeUq9CuqQ1OvI=/fit-in/1500x950/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Dr.MartensLEONAWOMENSVINTAGESMOOTHLEATHERHEELEDBOOTS-a71b74b0e21a4a878ccdff877659a4a5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dr. Martens</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another vintage-inspired style that has a bit more of a modern feel than the Oxfords are the Dr. Martens Leona boots. They also have a heel, if you’re looking for something with a little more height. But there are more details, too, like a platform sole and antiqued brass tunnel eyelets for the laces — which are a tad reminiscent of the classic <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Gucci heeled boots</a>. Think of it like a cross between the 1460s and Rometty Chelsea boots, but with a bit more flare.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>5-11 US Women's (runs large) | <strong>Construction: </strong>Smooth leather upper, antiqued brass tunnel eyelets, Airwair™ air-cushioned sole, slip-resistant sole, 2.25-inch heel height | <strong>Colors: </strong>Black</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dr-martens-molly-leather-platform-boots></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dr. Martens Molly Leather Platform Boots</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Molly Leather Platform Boots" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/hr8OyZ5Vwbsn4rliLxuvxpMVCDk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dr-martens-molly-leather-platform-boots-36eb6a56365f435ea8df8f22ed17d4c6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dr. Martens</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Still looking for your perfect Dr. Marten platform? Search no further than the Molly, a slightly more stylized version of a lace-up leather boot. This one only comes in women’s sizes, and has oversized eyelets and ribbon ties, adding subtle feminine details to the bold, chunky DM look we all know and love.

The Shriver is another popular Dr. Martens style, the Wyoming leather has a subtle grain, oily surface, and a more rugged feel than the brand's classic smooth leather. These boots might also be a good alternative to the 1460s, as one customer points out in their review, as they don't take as long to break in and the heel makes it more versatile for dressing up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>5-11 US Women's (runs large) | <strong>Construction: </strong>Rugged leather upper, cemented sole, 2.25-inch heel height | <strong>Colors: </strong>Black</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dr-martens-sinclair-platform-leather-boots></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dr. Martens Sinclair Platform Leather Boots</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sinclair Platform Leather Boots" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/rF_IUJTdyJk_XAh3FDNK35ukhIM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dr-martens-sinclair-platform-leather-boots-d566a29730bd4ff3bba7c76b5e831023.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dr. Martens</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If there’s one thing that most people can agree on with leather boots, it’s probably that they can sometimes be hard to put on. Lacing up boots can be an annoying task that requires extra time when you’re already running out the door, and we have all probably struggled with a pair of pull-on boots before, too. That’s what makes the Sinclair boots such a popular Dr. Martens style: They have a removable zipper closure, so you can choose between lacing up or zipping up — making these perhaps the most versatile option of them all. They also come in three different colorways and are available in both men's and women's sizing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>5-11 US Women's, 6-10 US Men's | <strong>Construction: </strong>Pebbled Nappa leather upper, Goodyear-welted lines, 1.5-inch platform height | <strong>Colors: </strong>Black, White, Burgundy</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-pick-the-right-doc-martins></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Pick the Right Doc Martins</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Heel Height</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Martens come in a variety of styles with different heel heights, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>combat boots</a> and oxfords, so it's important to think about which height is best for your purposes and lifestyle before purchasing a pair of your own.

Though other brands may mimic the silhouettes of some of Dr. Martens most popular pairs of shoes, the craftsmanship is one of a kind.&nbsp;</p><p>“There are a lot of brands out there creating similar models to the Jadon, 1460 and 1461, but the highly skilled manufacturing and product detail can not be replicated,” Jones explains. “The expertise that goes into making our boots, the attention to detail and the long-lasting durability sets Docs apart from the rest.”</p><p>The other thing that makes Dr. Martens such a fan favorite is their versatility and practicality in day-to-day life.&nbsp;“The simple silhouette allows people to customize each pair; whilst on a utilitarian level their famous durability and comfort make them ideal footwear for the world of gigs and street fashion,” Jones says. “On an emotional level, they are a flag of attitude and empowerment."</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How long do Dr. Martens shoes last?</span></p><p>If you take good care of your Dr. Martens, then it’s safe to say that they will last a very long time, with some customers stating theirs have lasted over 20 years. This comes down to particular craftsmanship and construction, of course.&nbsp;In fact, some Dr. Martens shoes are still created in the exact way they were more than 60 years ago, so you know they have the process down to a science.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“</strong>The Northamptonshire factory where it all began still exists to this day, in the village of Wollaston,” Jones says. "A specific range of ‘Made In England’ products are manufactured here by a small, close-knit team of people schooled in traditional shoe-making and a process that hasn’t changed since our first pair six decades ago."</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.86075949367089><p><span class=accordion__title>Are Dr. Martens waterproof?</span></p><p>While not every pair of Dr. Martens is waterproof, the brand does offer a wide variety of waterproofed footwear (like these <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Iowa Waterproof Poly Casual Boots</a>) that are great for snow, rain, and other elements.</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-take-our-word-for-it></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Take Our Word for It</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Olivia Muenter</a>&nbsp;is a freelance writer who has written for numerous outlets such as Refinery29, Glamour, and Byrdie.
