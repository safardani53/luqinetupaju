On occasion, he uploaded his picture on Instagram,&nbsp;accompanied by a long caption that described his coming out story six years ago. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Jim Rash shared his coming out story in his Instagram post.</strong>&nbsp;(Photo: Jim Rash’s Instagram)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In the caption, he hinted that the pictures taken six years back were from the moment of his life when he “started being more honest, freer, and happier.” That explained&nbsp;why he accepted himself as gay six years before the post, i.e., in the year 2012. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He further shared that he felt it was the right time to share his story with everyone and didn’t regret “not coming out earlier.”</p><p>For the past six years, I’ve been true, open and vulnerable.

But many sources have deemed him gay&nbsp;after he made the&nbsp;coming out post.

Similarly, there are no records of him marrying or having children.&nbsp;He is also very private about his personal life, which largely keeps his love life undisclosed.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>However, some rumors have been circulating online about him dating Nat Faxon. However, they are just close pals who have also collaborated on many on-screen projects.&nbsp;</p><h2>How old is Jim Rash?&nbsp;</h2><p>Born on July 15, 1970, in Charlotte, New York, U.S., Jim Rash's age is 51 as of writing. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-623 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Jim Rash was adopted when he was a child</h2><p>Rash’s biological parents are unknown since he was&nbsp;adopted as a child by an affable family along with his sister.</p><p>He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">lost</a> his father, who adopted him,&nbsp;some years back.
